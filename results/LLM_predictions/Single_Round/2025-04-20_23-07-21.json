        "headline": "Mag 7 Earnings &amp; DeepSeek: What Should Investors Know?",
        "content": "DeekSeek appears to have put a big dent in what everyone believed was a source of competitive advantage in the AI race for Tech leaders like Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL, Amazon AMZN, and others. And if we go by how Microsoft and Meta described the evolving AI competitive landscape on their respective Q4 earnings calls last week, we will most likely hear comparable commentary from Amazon and Alphabet as they come out with their December-quarter results this week.\n\nMarket participants have all along been skeptical of the investment case for the extraordinarily heavy spending by Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and others on AI-centric data centers and related infrastructure. The issue all along has been these companies\u2019 inability to articulate a clear case for how these investments will get monetized.\n\nWhile a lot about DeepSeek\u2019s actual cost in building and training its model is unknown, notwithstanding the announced figure of a few million dollars, the hundreds of billions of dollars that these companies are collectively pouring into the project appears to be overkill. Microsoft and Meta reiterated their spending plans and see the resulting data center capacity as giving them a strategic advantage in the long run. We can safely assume that Amazon and Alphabet will follow Microsoft and Meta on this crucial question.\n\nWhile the market\u2019s collective focus was mainly on the AI question for Microsoft and Meta, the former disappointed in its core results, with cloud guidance coming up short, while the latter showed plenty of operating momentum in operating results. Microsoft\u2019s December-quarter earnings were up +10.2% from the same period last year on +12.3% higher revenues, while Meta\u2019s earnings and revenues increased +48.7% and +20.6% from the year-earlier levels, respectively.\n\nApple and Tesla, the other Mag 7 players that also reported results last week, received favorable market reception. However, the positive market follow-through was likely less of a response to the core results and more of a sigh of relief at better-than-feared numbers.\n\nChina has emerged as a major risk in the Apple story, with tepid iPhone demand in that key market and the company\u2019s continuing AI struggles taking center stage. Some anecdotal evidence suggests that some of Apple\u2019s local Chinese competitors are giving it a lot tougher competition than in years past. On top of that is the prospect of tariffs, a far bigger issue for Apple than the rest of its Mag 7 peers.\n\nApple\u2019s December-quarter earnings were up +7.1% on +4% higher revenues, while Tesla\u2019s earnings and revenues for the period were up +15.7% and +2.1% from the year-earlier level, respectively. Net margins were up at Apple and Tesla, with Apple\u2019s margins up 86 basis points from the same period last year while Tesla\u2019s expanded 105 bps.\n\n\u7e7c\u7e8c\u95b1\u8b80\n\nTake a look at the chart below that shows current consensus expectations for the \u2018Mag 7\u2019 stocks as a whole for the current and coming periods in the context of what they were able to achieve in the preceding period.

The +16.9% earnings growth expected for the sector for 2025 at present is up from the +15.8% growth expected three months back.\n\nQ4 Earnings Season Scorecard\n\nThrough Friday, January 31st, we have seen Q4 results from 179 S&P 500 members, or 35.8% of the index\u2019s total membership. Total earnings for these companies are up +7.4% from the same period last year on +5.1% higher revenues, with 80.4% beating EPS estimates and 67% beating revenue estimates.\n\nThe comparison charts below put the Q4 earnings and revenue growth rates relative to other recent periods for the same group of index members.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe comparison charts below put the Q4 EPS and revenue beats percentages relative to other recent periods for the same group of companies.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nKey Earnings Reports This Week\n\nThe 132 S&P 500 members on deck to report results this week include several blue-chip operators like Pfizer, Pepsi, Ford, and others, in addition to the aforementioned Mag 7 players (Amazon and Alphabet).\n\nBy the end of this week, we will have seen Q4 results from more than 63% of the index\u2019s total membership.\n\nThe Earnings Big Picture\n\nThe chart below shows the Q4 earnings and revenue growth expectations in the context of where growth has been in the preceding four quarters and what is expected in the coming four quarters.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nExcluding the contribution from the Mag 7 companies, S&P 500 earnings would have been up +5.6% on +4.1% higher revenues.\n\nThe chart below shows the overall earnings picture on a calendar-year basis, with double-digit earnings growth expected in 2025 and 2026.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nPlease note that the very strong growth expected in 2025 is not driven by one or two sectors but is rather broad-based.

While Apple reported a modest earnings increase, concerns about iPhone demand in China and potential tariffs pose significant risks. The overall positive reception of the Mag 7 stocks, including Apple, suggests some investor relief, but the competitive challenges and market skepticism about AI investments could weigh on sentiment. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a cautious outlook with a slight inclination towards a price rise due to the overall positive market context."

                "reasoning": "The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While Apple's Q4 earnings and revenue showed growth, and the market reception was favorable (though possibly more of a relief than excitement), there are significant concerns. The primary negative factor is the increasing competition and tepid iPhone demand in China, a crucial market for Apple. The potential for tariffs also poses a greater risk to Apple compared to its Mag 7 peers. The news also highlights Apple's ongoing struggles with AI, which could impact its long-term competitiveness. Considering these factors, the negative aspects outweigh the positive, suggesting a higher probability of a stock price fall."

                "reasoning": "The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While Apple's Q4 earnings beat expectations and received favorable market reception, this was attributed more to relief than strong performance.  Concerns remain about tepid iPhone demand in China, increased competition, and the potential impact of tariffs.  The article highlights the significant AI investments by other tech giants (Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta), questioning their monetization strategy and suggesting Apple's AI struggles are a significant headwind.  The overall positive sentiment in the tech sector and the broader S&P 500 earnings season might offer some support to Apple's stock price. However, the specific challenges faced by Apple in China and its AI development outweigh the general positive market trends in this context. Therefore, the probability of a price fall is considered slightly higher than a price rise."

                "reasoning": "The news highlights several key points affecting Apple Inc. (AAPL). Firstly, Apple's earnings and revenues for the December quarter showed growth (+7.1% and +4% respectively), with net margins improving by 86 basis points. However, the company faces significant challenges in China, including tepid iPhone demand and increased competition from local Chinese competitors. Additionally, Apple's struggles in AI and potential tariffs pose further risks. While the market reacted favorably to Apple's better-than-feared results, the underlying issues in China and AI could weigh on investor sentiment. The mixed performance of other Mag 7 companies (e.g., Microsoft's cloud guidance shortfall vs. Meta's strong operating momentum) adds uncertainty to the broader tech sector. Given these factors, the probability of a stock price rise is tempered by the negative headwinds."

While Apple's December-quarter earnings were up +7.1% on +4% higher revenues, concerns about China's tepid iPhone demand and AI struggles are noted. However, Apple's net margins were up 86 basis points from the same period last year, which is a positive sign. The overall tech sector has seen a favorable revisions trend, with expected earnings growth of +19.2% for Q4 and +16.9% for 2025. Given the mixed but generally positive outlook for tech stocks and Apple's specific challenges in China, the stock price movement probabilities are estimated based on these factors."

While the competition could put downward pressure on Apple's stock, the suggestion that concerns are overblown implies a potential for the market to shrug off the news or even see it as an opportunity. Given Apple's strong brand, diverse product portfolio, and large cash reserves, it's likely to weather the competition effectively. Therefore, the probability of a significant stock price fall is somewhat mitigated. The market's reaction will depend on the details within the 'Continue Reading' section, which is unavailable. Without that information, a slightly higher probability is assigned to a price fall, but not overwhelmingly so."

        "headline": "Apple Scraps Work on Mac-Connected Augmented Reality Glasses",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. has canceled a project to build advanced augmented reality glasses that would pair with its devices, marking the latest setback in its effort to create a headset that appeals to typical consumers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHow the 2025 Catholic Jubilee Is Reshaping Rome Trump Paves the Way to Deputize Local Police on Immigration Manhattan\u2019s Morning Commute Time Drops With New Congestion Toll Historic London Elevator Faces Last Stop in Labour\u2019s Housing Push Housing Aid Uncertain After Trump\u2019s Spending Freeze Memo\n\nThe company shuttered the program this week, according to people with knowledge of the move. The now-canceled product would have looked like normal glasses but include built-in displays and require a connection to a Mac, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the work wasn\u2019t public. An Apple representative declined to comment.\n\nThe project had been seen as a potential way forward after the weak introduction of the Apple Vision Pro, a $3,499 model that was too cumbersome and pricey to catch on with consumers. The hope was to produce something that everyday users could embrace, but finding the right technology \u2014 at the right cost \u2014 has proven to be a challenge.\n\nApple risks losing ground to Meta Platforms Inc., which already sells a popular set of Ray-Ban smart glasses. Meta is working to create a version that adds augmented reality \u2014 the superimposing of images and data on real-world views \u2014 and expects to have a product ready by 2027. That\u2019s when Apple had previously intended to sell its device-connected glasses, which were code-named N107.\n\nThe decision to wind down work on the N107 product followed an attempt to revamp the design, according to the people. The company had initially wanted the glasses to pair with an iPhone, but it ran into problems over how much processing power the handset could provide. It also affected the iPhone\u2019s battery life. So the company shifted to an approach that required linking up with a Mac computer, which has faster processors and bigger batteries.\n\nBut the Mac-connected product performed poorly during reviews with executives, and the desired features continued to change. Members of Apple\u2019s Vision Products Group, which worked on the device, grew increasingly concerned that the project was on the rocks. Sure enough, the final word came this week that the effort was over.\n\nThe glasses are the latest example of Apple giving up on a once-promising technology. Last year, the company axed its decadelong effort to build a self-driving car. It also canceled work on custom Apple Watch screens in 2024.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe Vision Pro remains a technical marvel, even with its slow start. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook touted the product during an earnings conference call Thursday, saying that more corporate customers are embracing it.\n\nBut employees in Apple\u2019s Vision Products Group, or VPG, believe there\u2019s a lack of focus and clear direction within the team, which is overseen by executive Mike Rockwell and company hardware chief John Ternus. The N107 retreat is just the latest failed attempt to make Apple\u2019s headset technology successful, they say, and that\u2019s hurting morale.\n\nThe company is still working on successors to the Vision Pro, including updated versions of the original model. It also has other concepts in the works, such as AirPods with cameras, and executives still hope to eventually create a set of standalone AR glasses someday.\n\nApple has made other recent changes. Last week, one of the Vision Pro team\u2019s top executives moved to the AI division.\n\nThe N107 device had advanced projectors that could display information, images and video in the field of view for each eye, similar to augmented reality glasses being developed by Meta and others. Despite the project being shuttered, Apple is still working on underlying technologies that could be used in AR glasses down the road, including custom microLED-type screens, Bloomberg News reported this week.\n\nThe holy grail for the industry is creating fully standalone glasses \u2014 with their own screens, processor and operating system \u2014 that wouldn\u2019t require a smartphone or computer. Last year, Meta previewed prototype glasses called Orion that come close to this design, though they do connect to a wireless puck that handles the computing. Meta expects developers to start buying test units in 2026, helping them create software for the device. The launch of a consumer version \u2014 code-named Artemis \u2014 is planned for 2027.\n\nThe canceled Apple device also would have been similar to devices such as Xreal Inc.\u2019s One spectacles and Lenovo Group Ltd.\u2019s ThinkReality. The Vision Pro, in contrast, is a mixed-reality headset. It melds virtual reality with a version of AR that relies on cameras to show the outside world \u2014 rather than just letting users peer through glass at the real thing.\n\nWith its AR glasses project, Apple had hoped to capitalize on one of the more compelling features of visionOS, the operating system that runs on the Vision Pro. It can link up with a Mac and let people handle computing tasks in mixed reality. That means the Vision Pro can serve as a giant, virtual monitor that feels like it curves around a user.\n\nPrototypes of the device were light enough to not require a strap to wrap around a wearer\u2019s head \u2014 a requirement of the heavier Vision Pro. Apple also removed the front-facing screen on today\u2019s Vision Pro that shows a wearer\u2019s eyes. Though that technology is one of the more memorable aspects of the current headset, the feature adds cost and weight.\n\nBut the device did still have some bells and whistles: The company worked on including lenses that could change their tint depending on what a user is doing. The idea was to tell an onlooker if the person is present and approachable \u2014 or busy working on computing tasks.\n\nThe N107 decision marks at least the second time Apple has walked away from an AR project. Around two years ago, it shelved its first effort, a project code-named N421. Apple had originally aimed to bring those glasses to market around a year after the initial Vision Pro. Apple canceled N421, in part, to focus on a new mixed-reality headset code-named N109, which has been discussed as a cheaper variant of the Vision Pro\u2019s VR-based design.\n\nCompany executives were originally compelled by the N107 idea because of past success with devices like the Apple Watch and AirPods, which serve as accessories to its main products. In recent years, Apple\u2019s Wearables, Home and Accessories segment has eclipsed its Mac and iPad divisions in revenue.\n\nThe failure of the N107 glasses leaves Apple with one fewer avenue for finding a new hit product. So far, the Vision Pro doesn\u2019t have mass consumer appeal.\n\nWithin Apple, the Vision Pro\u2019s slow sales were initially blamed on its hefty price tag \u2014 roughly seven times the level of Meta\u2019s Quest 3 headset. But there\u2019s been another, more troubling development: People who already own the device aren\u2019t using it as much as the company had anticipated.\n\nThat puts Apple in a quandary. Even if it can make a headset cheaper and lighter, it still has to figure out how to make the product resonate with consumers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIndy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans The Internet Almost Killed Barnes & Noble, Then Saved It What America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments",

The news highlights ongoing challenges with the Vision Pro and suggests a lack of clear direction in Apple's AR strategy. Given that the company has previously scrapped other ambitious projects, this may raise concerns about its innovation pipeline and ability to compete with rivals like Meta. As a result, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of it rising."

                "reasoning": "The news headline and content indicate a negative development for Apple. Scrapping the Mac-connected AR glasses project suggests challenges in Apple's innovation pipeline and potential loss of ground to competitors like Meta in the AR space. While Apple is still working on other AR initiatives and successors to the Vision Pro, the cancellation of this specific project, coupled with concerns about the Vision Pro's adoption rate and internal team morale, points towards short-term negative sentiment. However, Tim Cook's positive comments on the Vision Pro and ongoing work on underlying AR technologies provide some counterweight. Given these factors, a slight negative impact on the stock price is more likely than a positive one, but the overall impact is likely to be moderate as Apple has other ongoing projects and a strong overall financial position."

                "reasoning": "The news of Apple canceling its AR glasses project (N107) is generally negative for Apple's stock. While the Vision Pro remains a product in their lineup, the cancellation highlights challenges in the AR/VR market and Apple's struggles to create a consumer-friendly product in this space.  The failure of N107, following the lukewarm reception of the Vision Pro, suggests difficulties in innovation and market entry for this technology.  This could lead to investor concern about Apple's future growth prospects in a potentially lucrative but challenging market. However, the news is not catastrophic. Apple is still investing in AR/VR technology and has other projects underway.  The overall impact on the stock price is likely to be muted, with a slightly higher probability of a minor price decrease due to the negative sentiment surrounding the cancellation.  The existing positive sentiment around Apple's overall performance and other product lines will likely mitigate any significant negative impact."

This cancellation marks another setback in Apple's efforts to create a consumer-friendly headset, following previous cancellations like the self-driving car project. The decision reflects challenges in technology and cost, and the company risks losing ground to competitors like Meta Platforms Inc. The news also mentions internal concerns about lack of focus and direction within the Vision Products Group, which could hurt morale. While Apple is still working on other projects like updated versions of the Vision Pro and AirPods with cameras, the cancellation of the AR glasses project could signal ongoing struggles in innovation and product development. Given this context, the market may react negatively to the news, perceiving it as a lack of progress in Apple's AR/VR ambitions."

This cancellation, following the weak introduction of the Apple Vision Pro, suggests that Apple is facing challenges in creating a successful headset product that appeals to typical consumers. The project was seen as a potential way forward, but its cancellation indicates that Apple may be struggling to find a winning formula in the AR/VR space. Additionally, the risk of losing ground to Meta Platforms Inc., which is working on its own AR glasses, adds to the negative outlook.

The cancellation of this project, combined with the slow sales of the Apple Vision Pro, may lead investors to question Apple's ability to innovate and compete in the emerging AR market. Additionally, the fact that Apple is losing ground to Meta Platforms Inc. in the AR space may further contribute to a negative sentiment.

This suggests potential downside risk. On the other hand, Apple's capital expenditure model, which leverages the investments of other Big Tech companies in AI infrastructure, is seen as a positive, making them less vulnerable to competition like DeepSeek. This could be a stabilizing factor. The analyst maintains a 'Hold' rating, indicating a neutral stance. Considering these factors, the probability of a significant rise seems limited, while the probability of a fall is moderate due to concerns about iPhone sales and the lack of a clear AI-driven upgrade cycle. The overall sentiment leans slightly negative."

While the analyst highlights Apple's less aggressive CapEx spending as a positive factor mitigating the impact of increased AI spending by competitors (like the DeepSeek effect on Nvidia), he maintains a 'Hold' rating on the stock.  This is primarily due to concerns about a potential mismatch in hardware and software rollouts impacting iPhone sales and uncertainty regarding an AI-driven upgrade cycle. The analyst's 'Hold' rating suggests a neutral outlook, implying neither a strong bullish nor bearish sentiment.  The lack of a clear positive catalyst from the AI boom, coupled with existing concerns about iPhone sales, leans slightly towards a neutral to slightly negative outlook in the short term.

        "headline": "DeepSeek rattled Big Tech. Here's what the CEOs of Apple, Meta and Microsoft are saying",
        "content": "The DeepSeek app is displayed on an iPhone screen. - Illustration: Justin Sullivan (Getty Images)\n\nEarlier this week, Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek sparked a sell-off of global tech stocks that lost the AI-driven stock rally $1 trillion in value.\n\nThe Hangzhou-based company launched its open-source DeepSeek-R1 AI reasoning models the previous week, declaring them on par with those from OpenAI and Anthropic. In December, the startup released DeepSeek-V3, an AI model it said cost just $5.6 million to train and develop on just under 2,050 of Nvidia\u2019s (NVDA) reduced-capability H800 chips. V3, according to the startup\u2019s technical paper, performed comparably to OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o and Meta\u2019s (META) Llama 3.1 models, which use a much larger quantity of Nvidia\u2019s more powerful chips.\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s cheaper-yet-competitive models have raised questions over Big Tech\u2019s big spending on AI infrastructure. Unsurprisingly, the Chinese startup made its way into Big Tech earnings calls this week, and the chief executives of Microsoft, Meta, and Apple took an optimistic tone while discussing what DeepSeek\u2019s models could mean for the industry.\n\nHere\u2019s what Big Tech is saying about DeepSeek.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nDespite launching an investigation this week over whether a group associated with DeepSeek obtained data output from OpenAI\u2019s AI models in violation of the startup\u2019s terms of service, Microsoft launched DeepSeek-R1 on its Azure AI Foundry (MSFT) and GitHub.\n\nMicrosoft chief executive Satya Nadella said during the company\u2019s earnings call on Wednesday that developers will also be able to run the startup\u2019s distilled reasoning models on Copilot+ PCs soon.\n\nIn response to an analyst\u2019s question about DeepSeek, Nadella said he thinks it \u201chas had some real innovations.\u201d As AI reasoning models such as those from DeepSeek and OpenAI get \u201ccommoditized\u201d and \u201cbroadly used,\u201d Nadella said customers will be \u201cthe big beneficiaries\u201d of that software cycle.\n\n\u201cWhen token prices fall, inference computing prices fall, that means people can consume more, and there will be more apps written,\u201d Nadella said.\n\nMeta\n\nMeta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg, who touts open-source AI models as \u201cgood for the world,\u201d said during the company\u2019s earnings call on Wednesday that DeepSeek did \u201ca number of novel things\u201d with its open-source models that the industry is \u201cstill digesting,\u201d and that the startup has made \u201cadvances that we will hope to implement in our systems.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s part of the nature of how this works,\u201d he said, \u201cwhether it\u2019s a Chinese competitor or not.\u201d\n\nHowever, Zuckerberg said it\u2019s too early to have a strong opinion on what DeepSeek means for the trajectory of Meta\u2019s plans for AI infrastructure and capital expenditures.\n\nLa historia contin\u00faa\n\nEarlier this month, Zuckerberg said Meta is planning to invest between $60 billion and $65 billion in capex on AI this year. The company is also building a data center with a capacity of more than two gigawatts, he said \u2014 a site that could cover a large part of Manhattan. Meta plans to bring about one gigawatt of compute online this year, Zuckerberg said, and will end the year with more than 1.3 million graphics processing units, or GPUs.\n\nApple\n\nWhile Apple (AAPL) stock avoided the DeepSeek sell-off, Apple chief executive Tim Cook was asked by an analyst for his \u201cworldly perspective\u201d on the AI startup and its implications for the iPhone maker\u2019s business.\n\n\u201cIn general, I think innovation that drives efficiency is a good thing,\u201d Cook said. \u201cYou know, that\u2019s what you see in that model.\u201d\n\nHowever, Apple is facing another problem in China, with its revenue being down 11% year over year for the quarter ended in December.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nVer comentarios",

On one hand, the emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup, raises concerns about increased competition and potential cost efficiencies in AI development, which could indirectly benefit Apple. Tim Cook's comment about innovation driving efficiency being a good thing suggests a positive outlook on DeepSeek's impact. However, the article also mentions Apple's revenue decline in China, which is a significant negative factor. The overall impact is likely to be slightly negative, as the China revenue decline is a more immediate and direct concern than the potential long-term benefits of DeepSeek's innovations.

While DeepSeek's advancements in AI could potentially disrupt the industry, Apple's CEO's comments suggest a view of it as driving efficiency, which could be positive in the long term. However, the news also highlights Apple's existing challenges in China, with an 11% year-over-year revenue decline. This negative factor counterbalances the potential positive impact of the DeepSeek news.  The overall impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be muted given the lack of direct impact mentioned by Apple's CEO and the pre-existing negative news regarding China revenue. Therefore, the probabilities are weighted towards a neutral stance, with a slightly higher chance of a price rise due to the generally positive sentiment expressed by Cook."

He views DeepSeek's models as a positive development, stating that innovation driving efficiency is a good thing. Additionally, Apple is facing challenges in China with its revenue down 11% year over year, but this does not seem to have directly impacted investor sentiment regarding its stock price movement. Given the information provided and the neutral to positive tone from Apple's CEO regarding AI advancements, it seems that the stock price might not be significantly negatively affected in the short term.

The article highlights other companies' successes and failures in the AI cloud space, but provides no specific information that would significantly impact Apple's stock price.

        "content": "We recently published a list of Coatue\u2019s 35 Most Important AI Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against Coatue\u2019s other most important AI stocks.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has fueled a major rally in the technology sector, driving up key market indices. Over the past year, the S&P 500, heavily influenced by tech giants, has risen by nearly 22%, while the tech-heavy NASDAQ Composite has surged over 26%. Initially, market analysts had predicted an increase in interest around growth options for 2024 due to easing inflation and potential rate cuts. However, AI has taken this expected interest and amplified it into an economy-wide wave of optimism. While tech stocks have been the primary beneficiaries, AI\u2019s influence is expanding across industries such as manufacturing, supply chain, transportation, entertainment, and retail.\n\nInvestment in AI is growing rapidly across various sectors. A recent Goldman Sachs report estimates that global businesses will invest nearly $1 trillion in AI infrastructure over the next few years. Venture capital (VC) investments in AI startups are also on the rise. In the first half of 2024 alone, VC firms made approximately 200 AI-related deals, injecting nearly $22 billion into the sector. The average AI startup funding round now exceeds $100 million, with company valuations averaging over $1 billion. In contrast, non-AI startups typically receive around $20 million in funding and have valuations near $200 million, indicating AI\u2019s outsized appeal to investors.\n\nCompanies that were early adopters of AI have experienced significant gains, particularly those specializing in graphics processing units (GPUs), AI chips, and generative AI technologies. The median returns of AI-linked firms in the S&P 500 stand at 20%, compared to just 2% for non-AI stocks. AI companies are also responsible for 90% of the total returns on the NASDAQ Composite Index. These gains are expected to drive earnings growth and contribute to broader economic expansion. According to Joseph Briggs, a senior global economist at Goldman Sachs, AI is projected to automate 25% of all work tasks in the next decade, increasing US productivity by 9% and boosting GDP growth by more than 6%.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nPhilippe Laffont of Coatue Management argues that AI could be the start of a new \u201csuper cycle\u201d in the tech industry. Previous cycles included the rise of personal computers in the 1980s, networking in the 1990s, wired internet in the 2000s, and mobile internet in the 2010s, leading to the cloud era. However, software and internet experts Kash Rangan and Eric Sheridan highlight a key difference: this time, companies are linking AI investments directly to revenue generation, providing a financial safety net that was absent in past cycles.\n\nStory Continues\n\nSince the launch of ChatGPT by OpenAI in early 2023, the industry\u2019s focus has shifted from software to AI hardware and infrastructure. AI infrastructure companies have collectively added nearly $6 trillion to their market capitalization since Q1 2023. Before large-scale AI automation becomes commonplace\u2014MIT economist Daron Acemoglu estimates this will take more than a decade\u2014AI infrastructure is expanding into areas such as utilities, energy, internet, and industrials. Interestingly, companies in these sectors that support AI development have posted returns rivaling those of traditional AI firms.\n\nThe growing demand for AI-driven data centers is also driving investments in the energy and utilities sectors. Goldman Sachs analysts Carly Davenport and Alberto Gandolf expect AI adoption to drive a surge in electricity demand not seen in decades. However, whether AI\u2019s growth will align with energy infrastructure investments remains uncertain due to regulatory constraints and supply chain limitations in the utilities sector. Even if necessary investments materialize, their full benefits may take years to reach AI companies.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nSome investors remain cautious, fearing an AI bubble similar to the dot-com crash of the early 2000s. However, current data suggests that AI valuations are far more grounded than those of the dot-com era. At the height of the dot-com bubble, software firms traded at price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios of 132x, compared to a five-year average of 37x in 1999. In contrast, in 2023, even the biggest AI stocks had P/E ratios around 39x, with a five-year average of 40x. These figures suggest that AI valuations are not overinflated, reinforcing investor confidence in AI\u2019s long-term potential.\n\nAI companies are increasingly targeting multi-trillion-dollar valuations, comparable to today\u2019s largest software and internet firms. Over the past decade, tech giants have scaled their businesses to unprecedented levels, combining billions of users, hundreds of billions in revenue, and tens of billions in net income. Today, a handful of firms account for 80% of the valuation of the Fortune 500. These companies dominate industries such as smartphones, e-commerce, cloud computing, and software-as-a-service (SaaS), all of which AI is poised to disrupt. As a result, these firms are aggressively incorporating AI into their business strategies to maintain market leadership.\n\nSome investors worry that AI firms could overshadow software companies, impacting long-term valuations. The price-to-sales (P/S) ratio for software stocks, which peaked in 2021, is now at an all-time low. Slower earnings growth has also contributed to negative sentiment in the sector. Coatue\u2019s research shows that over the next twelve months, only 1% of SaaS companies expect 30% earnings growth, down from 30% during the SaaS boom. However, as human-machine interaction shifts towards natural language processing and generative AI, software companies that successfully integrate AI into their platforms are likely to thrive.\n\nAs inflation cools, rate hikes ease, and prospects for a soft economic landing improve, AI\u2019s macroeconomic outlook remains strong. AI is now the primary driver of future earnings growth in the S&P 500. According to Coatue\u2019s projections, AI-linked stocks are expected to grow at a compound annual rate of nearly 20% over the next three years, outperforming non-AI stocks by approximately 14%. Additionally, 40% of future tech sector earnings are expected to be fueled by AI advancements. All available data points to a bright future for AI investments, with its influence extending far beyond traditional tech firms. As companies continue integrating AI into their operations, productivity and economic growth are set to accelerate, making AI one of the most transformative forces in modern history.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through a note on the AI industry by Coatue Management. These stocks are also popular among other hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Apple Inc. (AAPL): Integrating AI in Devices for Personal Privacy\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. In October 2024, the company launched Apple Intelligence, a personal AI system for iPhone, iPad, and Mac, designed to assist users in writing, expressing themselves, and completing tasks efficiently. This system emphasizes user privacy by processing data on-device, ensuring personal information remains secure. Financially, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported a record revenue of $94.9 billion in the September 2024 quarter, marking a 6% increase from the previous year. CEO Tim Cook attributed this growth to the introduction of new products, including the iPhone 16 lineup, Apple Watch Series 10, and AirPods 4. Despite the introduction of AI features, the iPhone 16 series did not experience a significant sales boost, leading to concerns about the immediate financial benefits of AI.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 6th on our list of Coatue\u2019s most important AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for a stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

However, the article also notes that Apple's recent integration of AI into its products (Apple Intelligence) hasn't yet resulted in a significant sales boost for the iPhone 16, suggesting that the immediate financial impact of this AI integration might be limited.  The article ranks AAPL 6th on a list of Coatue's most important AI stocks, implying that other companies are considered more promising for higher returns in the short term.  While the broader AI market optimism could support AAPL's stock price, the lack of immediate demonstrable financial benefit from Apple's AI initiatives suggests a more muted impact on the stock price compared to other AI-focused companies. Therefore, the probability of a price rise is moderate, while the probability of a price fall is relatively low, reflecting the overall positive market sentiment towards AI but tempered by Apple's specific situation."

        "headline": "Can This Popular Vanguard Tech ETF Trounce the S&amp;P 500 Again in 2025?",
        "content": "Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have transformed the investing landscape since their 1993 debut, attracting investors with their straightforward approach to diversification. By allowing individuals to buy shares that track entire market indexes or sectors, ETFs eliminate the challenge and risk of selecting individual stocks while keeping costs minimal.\n\nThe technology sector particularly exemplifies the power of ETF investing in the years following the 2008 financial crisis. As digital innovation has fundamentally altered how we communicate, work, and live -- from the rise of social media to the recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI) -- tech-focused ETFs have delivered exceptional returns since the financial crisis while providing investors broad exposure to this transformative industry.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe Vanguard Information Technology ETF(NYSEMKT: VGT) has been a particularly potent investing vehicle since its 2004 debut, turning the digital revolution into market-beating gains. Beyond consistent market outperformance, the fund's rock-bottom expense ratio of 0.10% maximizes investor returns, compared to the industry average of 0.93%.\n\nThe fund's stellar performance in 2024 reinforces its winning strategy. While the S&P 500 posted an exceptional 25% total return (including dividends), the Vanguard Information Technology ETF delivered an even more remarkable 29.3% gain to shareholders.VGT Total Return Level data by YCharts.\n\nCan this popular Vanguard tech ETF outperform yet again in 2025? Let's dig deeper to find out.\n\nMarket outlook\n\nAt the start of the year, Wall Street's consensus projected a roughly 10% total return (including dividends) for the benchmark S&P 500. While a lot has transpired since these projections were made -- Trump has taken office, DeepSeek shook the AI world -- this 10% figure gives us a benchmark to gauge the attractiveness of the Vanguard Information Technology ETF in 2025.\n\nHistorically, the Vanguard Information Technology ETF has averaged a total annual return of 13.7% since its inception 21 years ago. That figure implies the fund should beat out the S&P 500 again in 2025, but a deeper look suggests this year may not be typical for the ETF from a performance standpoint.\n\nPortfolio composition and valuation concerns\n\nAn analysis of the fund's portfolio structure reveals why its historical performance trajectory may shift in the coming year. The fund maintains significant concentration risk, with 45% of its assets allocated to three technology leaders: Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), and Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT).\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhile analysts project robust double-digit revenue growth for both Nvidia and Microsoft in 2025, their current valuations -- with forward price-to-earnings ratios (P/Es) above 30 -- suggest much of this anticipated growth is already reflected in their stock prices.\n\nApple presents additional concerns heading into 2025. The company's recent decision to integrate ChatGPT through an OpenAI partnership across its operating systems marks a departure from its traditional innovation leadership. This strategic pivot toward following rather than setting AI trends could potentially erode Apple's premium market positioning.\n\nGiven these factors -- the elevated valuations of Nvidia and Microsoft, combined with Apple's strategic challenges -- the fund's largest holdings may struggle to deliver the market-beating returns investors have come to expect. This concentration in potentially overvalued assets introduces meaningful risk to the fund's near-term performance outlook.\n\nGrowth catalysts and market dynamics\n\nThe emergence of DeepSeek's cost-effective AI models has sparked debate about the massive AI investments planned by U.S. technology leaders. While these companies continue to commit trillions to AI development, DeepSeek's breakthrough raises questions about the necessity of such extensive capital deployment.\n\nThis development marks a pivotal moment in AI's evolution. Chinese companies have demonstrated their abilities to create capable chatbots without relying on the most advanced semiconductor technology.\n\nHowever, pursuing artificial general intelligence (AGI) still depends heavily on specialized AI processors, a market where Nvidia maintains clear technological leadership. This dynamic creates an intriguing tension between emerging cost-efficient approaches and the continued value of cutting-edge hardware infrastructure.\n\nWhile the U.S. pursuit of AGI should continue driving robust revenue growth for Microsoft and Nvidia, the accelerating pace of Chinese AI development introduces new strategic and competitive risks. This evolving landscape suggests that even market leaders must navigate an increasingly complex technological and geopolitical environment.\n\nInvestment outlook\n\nThe Vanguard Information Technology ETF enters 2025 in unfamiliar territory. Unlike its consistent market-beating performance since the 2008 financial crisis, the fund now faces unique challenges. The AI landscape has grown more complex, with Chinese developments like DeepSeek demonstrating that competitive language models can be built without cutting-edge semiconductor technology.\n\nWhile DeepSeek may ultimately prove less capable than the sophisticated models from Anthropic, Alphabet, and OpenAI -- and the pursuit of AGI will likely continue to require Nvidia's advanced AI processors -- the broader investment thesis has shifted. For the first time in over fifteen years, this widely held Vanguard fund no longer presents the compelling case for outperformance that investors have come to expect.\n\nThis uncertainty doesn't necessarily signal underperformance but suggests a more nuanced risk-reward profile that investors should carefully evaluate against their portfolio objectives.\n\nTaking the long view\n\nWhile the Vanguard Information Technology ETF may face near-term headwinds in 2025, its long-term growth potential remains compelling. Artificial intelligence represents a genuine technological revolution, rather than a passing trend, with its transformative effects already visible across industries and societies.\n\nThe economic impact of AI is expected to be profound, with projections suggesting it could generate trillions in global economic value by 2030. This fundamental shift in the technological landscape makes the Vanguard Information Technology ETF an attractive long-term investment opportunity, even as it navigates temporary uncertainties. The fund's exposure to key players in the AI revolution positions it well to capture substantial value creation over the next decade and beyond.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Additionally, the elevated valuations of its major holdings, including Apple, Nvidia, and Microsoft, suggest that much of the anticipated growth is already priced in.

                "reasoning": "The news article focuses on the Vanguard Information Technology ETF (VGT) and its potential performance in 2025, with a significant portion discussing Apple's (AAPL) role within the ETF. While the article acknowledges the long-term potential of AI and the tech sector, it raises concerns about Apple's strategic direction (following AI trends instead of leading) and its potential impact on the ETF's performance. The article also highlights valuation concerns for Nvidia and Microsoft, which, along with Apple, constitute a large portion of the ETF's holdings. The 'Double Down' advertisement at the end is a general marketing tactic and doesn't directly influence the analysis of Apple's stock. Given the concerns raised about Apple's AI strategy and its potential impact on future growth, there's a slightly higher probability of a stock price fall than a rise in the short term. However, the article also mentions Apple's integration of ChatGPT, which could be seen as a positive move by some investors, mitigating the negative sentiment to some extent."

                "reasoning": "The news article focuses on the Vanguard Information Technology ETF (VGT), which heavily invests in Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Nvidia (NVDA). While the article highlights the long-term potential of AI and the ETF's holdings, it expresses concerns about the near-term performance.  Specifically, it mentions the high valuations of MSFT and NVDA, and questions Apple's strategic shift in AI, suggesting it might be following trends rather than setting them. The emergence of cost-effective AI models from Chinese companies also introduces competitive risks.  Therefore, the article presents a mixed outlook, suggesting uncertainty rather than a clear bullish or bearish signal for AAPL.  The probability of a price rise is tempered by the concerns about Apple's strategic direction and the overall valuation concerns of the ETF's major holdings. The probability of a price fall is also not high, as the long-term prospects for AI remain positive, and Apple remains a major player in the tech sector.  The overall impact of this news on AAPL's stock price is likely to be muted."

The analysis highlights concerns about Apple's strategic pivot towards AI through its OpenAI partnership, which may erode its premium market positioning. Additionally, the ETF's concentration in potentially overvalued stocks like Nvidia and Microsoft introduces near-term risks. However, the long-term potential of AI and Apple's role in it is acknowledged. Given these mixed signals, the probability of Apple's stock price movement is balanced but slightly tilted towards caution due to strategic uncertainties."

Additionally, Apple's strategic pivot towards integrating ChatGPT through an OpenAI partnership may erode its premium market positioning. However, the article also notes that the pursuit of artificial general intelligence (AGI) is likely to continue driving robust revenue growth for Microsoft and Nvidia.

This suggests that the market is stabilizing after initial fears, which could lead to a rise in Apple\u2019s stock price.

        "content": "(Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures rose on Friday, driven by gains in Apple following a strong sales growth forecast, as investors focused on key inflation data expected later in the day that could influence the Federal Reserve's policy decisions.\n\nApple gained 3.4% in premarket trading after its earnings on Thursday, when executives forecast relatively strong sales growth, a sign the company would recover from a dip in iPhone sales as it rolls out AI features.\n\n\"On the whole, investors appeared reassured by guidance that revenue growth is expected in the low- to mid-single digits in the coming quarter,\" Deutsche Bank analysts said in a note.\n\nThe December personal consumption expenditures price index is due to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET, with headline inflation expected to increase 0.3% month-on-month and 2.6% annually.\n\nExcluding the volatile food and energy components, the PCE price index is expected to rise 0.2%. Annually, it is expected to stay put at 2.8%, according to economists polled by Reuters.\n\nThe central bank held interest rates steady in its latest rate decision earlier this week, and Fed Chair Jerome Powell said there would be no rush to cut them again until inflation and jobs data made it appropriate to do so.\n\nIntel advanced 2% after the chipmaker posted December-quarter results that beat analysts' low expectations, while its forecast for current-quarter revenue missed estimates.\n\nOil majors Chevron and Exxon Mobil are among the major companies scheduled to report quarterly earnings before the bell on Friday.\n\nAt 04:51 a.m. ET, Dow E-minis were up 131 points, or 0.29%, S&P 500 E-minis were up 24.5 points, or 0.4% and Nasdaq 100 E-minis were up 153.5 points, or 0.71%.\n\nThe S&P 500 as well as the Nasdaq were set for weekly losses as tech shares suffered a rout earlier this week after Chinese startup DeepSeek unveiled a breakthrough in cheap artificial-intelligence models, triggering a bloodbath in AI-linked stocks.\n\nMicrosoft plunged more than 6% on Thursday following a disappointing growth forecast in its cloud computing business, exacerbating broader losses.\n\nDespite this week's volatility, all three major indexes were on track for monthly gains, with the S&P 500 less than 1% from its all-time high, hit last week.\n\nJanuary has been a mixed month for equities in this century, with the S&P 500's returns flat on average since 2000, according to data compiled by LSEG.\n\nMeanwhile, global markets remained vigilant after U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday that the United States would impose a 25% tariff on imports from Mexico and Canada, repeating his warning ahead of his previously announced Saturday deadline.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAmong other early movers, Deckers Outdoor dropped 14.6% after the UGG bootmaker's annual sales forecast raise fell short of investors' lofty expectations after a strong holiday quarter.\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance lost 10.5% after the pharmacy chain operator suspended its quarterly cash dividend amid restructuring efforts.\n\n(Reporting by Shashwat Chauhan in Bengaluru; Editing by Pooja Desai)\n\nView Comments",

Apple's premarket trading shows a significant gain of 3.4% after earnings, driven by expectations of recovery from iPhone sales dip and the introduction of AI features. Analysts' notes reinforce the positive sentiment, citing reassurance from the revenue growth guidance. While the broader market is influenced by inflation data and other economic factors, the specific news regarding Apple is strongly positive.

However, the overall market context is mixed.  While the broader market indices are showing positive premarket movement, influenced by Apple's performance and anticipation of inflation data, there are countervailing factors.  The upcoming inflation data release could significantly impact the market, potentially affecting Apple's stock price regardless of its positive earnings report.  Furthermore, recent volatility in the tech sector, exemplified by Microsoft's drop following a disappointing forecast, highlights the risk of negative market sentiment impacting even strong performers.  Considering the positive premarket reaction to Apple's earnings and the generally positive market sentiment, the probability of a price rise is higher, but the uncertainty surrounding inflation data and broader market trends necessitates a less than certain prediction."

While Apple is set to report earnings, the overall sentiment in the tech sector is negative due to the impact of DeepSeek on major players like Nvidia and Microsoft. This could lead to cautious trading around Apple's stock, especially if the earnings report does not meet expectations. Given the current market environment and the potential for negative sentiment to affect Apple's stock, there is a higher probability of a price decline than an increase."

                "reasoning": "The news presents a mixed picture for Apple (AAPL). On one hand, the overall tech sector is facing increased competition from Chinese AI startups like DeepSeek, which has caused market volatility and concerns about US tech dominance. This could negatively impact investor sentiment towards Apple. Additionally, the news mentions that investors are awaiting Apple's earnings results, which introduces uncertainty. If the earnings are below expectations, the stock price could fall. On the other hand, the news doesn't directly mention any specific negative impacts on Apple's business. The fact that Meta's stock climbed after earnings beat expectations suggests that positive earnings results could boost Apple's stock. Given the uncertainty surrounding the earnings report and the general market volatility, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a stock price fall than a rise."

                "reasoning": "The news focuses heavily on DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup, and its impact on the tech sector.  DeepSeek's competitive AI model caused a significant sell-off in tech stocks, including Nvidia, which lost a substantial portion of its market value. While Apple's earnings are imminent, the overall negative sentiment surrounding the AI landscape and the uncertainty created by DeepSeek's emergence overshadows the potential positive impact of strong Apple earnings.  The news doesn't directly mention Apple's AI capabilities or any negative impacts on Apple specifically, but the broader market reaction suggests a heightened risk of a negative spillover effect.  Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is higher than a rise, although the probability of a rise is not zero due to the potential for positive earnings results."

While Apple's earnings are anticipated, the broader market sentiment is negative due to concerns over AI competition and potential impacts on Big Tech. Given the uncertainty and the sell-off in related stocks like Nvidia and Microsoft, there is a heightened risk of negative sentiment spilling over to Apple. However, Apple's strong brand and diversified revenue streams may provide some resilience. The lack of specific negative news directly about Apple tempers the downside risk."

However, it also mentions that Meta's stock climbed after its earnings call, where the company announced plans to invest hundreds of billions of dollars in AI infrastructure. For Apple, the article only mentions that its earnings are coming, without providing any specific information about the company's performance. Given the mixed signals in the article, the probability of Apple's stock price rising or falling is uncertain. However, since the article does not provide any negative news about Apple, and the company's earnings are expected to be released soon, which could potentially bring positive news, the probability of the stock price rising might be slightly higher than the probability of it falling."

While the stock is getting a boost from 'DeepSeek news' (unspecified, but assumed positive in the short term), the core message is that AI isn't yet driving iPhone upgrades. This implies that the positive impact might be temporary and the long-term impact of AI on Apple's revenue is still uncertain. The lack of immediate impact on iPhone sales, which are a major revenue driver, suggests a potential for the stock to fall after the initial boost fades. Therefore, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a stock price fall than rise."

This suggests that the current positive momentum is not directly linked to Apple's AI strategy.  The absence of a significant AI-driven upgrade cycle implies a potential for limited near-term stock price increases directly attributable to AI.  Therefore, the probability of a price rise is moderate, primarily driven by factors outside the AI narrative.  The probability of a price fall is also relatively low, as the news doesn't present any negative developments.  The overall market sentiment and other factors will likely have a greater influence on the stock price than this specific news."

This indicates that the current boost might be short-lived as the fundamental driver (AI upgrades) is not yet impacting sales significantly. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is moderate but tempered by the lack of immediate AI-driven growth, while the probability of a fall is slightly lower but still present due to potential investor disappointment."

        "content": "Investing.com - Shares in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) were higher in premarket U.S. trading, rebounding from an initial dip following the iPhone maker's latest quarterly results.\n\nExecutives at the company said the group now expects sales to grow in the low- to mid-single digits in its fiscal second quarter. The guidance surpassed expectations and pointed to momentum in demand for the iPhone, Reuters reported, citing analysts.\n\nThe rosier outlook helped to assuage some worries around sales for Apple's flagship handset, which dropped marginally and missed estimates in its key holiday shopping quarter, due in part to the firm's new AI features not being available in some markets. Still, CEO Tim Cook said the enhancements, known as Apple Intelligence, are boosting sales.\n\nApple has taken a more cautious approach to AI compared to its Silicon Valley peers, choosing not to spend heavily on building out data centers. The strategy seemed to help insulate the stock during the DeepSeek-inspired market turmoil earlier this week, which led to steep drops in other Big Tech shares.\n\nFor the three months ended December 28, Apple reported earnings of $2.42 per share on revenue of $124.3 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com had anticipated EPS of $2.36 on revenue of $124.12 billion.\n\nHowever, iPhone sales, which account for nearly half of total revenue, fell to $69.14 billion from $69.70 billion a year earlier, short of estimates of $71.03 billion.\n\nApple's services unit, which includes its Apple Pay and App Store offerings, increased by around 14% year-on-year to $26.34 billion, compared with Wall Street estimates of $26.09 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, in the latest sign that competition in China's smartphone market remains intense, Apple's sales in Greater China were down 11% to $18.5 billion, well below analyst projections of $21.57 billion.\n\nIn a note to clients, analysts at DA Davidson led by Gil Luria called Apple's first-quarter results \"mixed\", with \"positive notes in various segments [being] slightly overshadowed by some negatives, primarily out of Greater China\".\n\n\"That being said, Apple Intelligence is clearly benefiting iPhone growth in regions/countries where it is available. And while it is still being rolled out slower than initially anticipated, new regions will have their hands on Apple Intelligence soon, along with new features for existing users,\" Luria wrote.\n\n(Yasin Ebrahim contributed reporting.)\n\nRelated Articles\n\nApple shares rise as rosy sales outlook suggests iPhone demand momentum\n\nStory Continues\n\nSCA Q4 sales rise 17%, boosted by higher prices and increased volumes\n\nBofA's Hartnett says US exceptionalism is 'peaking'\n\nView Comments",

        "headline": "Futures higher, Trump's tariff threats, Apple earnings - what's moving markets",
        "content": "Investing.com - U.S. stock futures pointed higher on Friday, with investors pouring through fresh tariff threats from U.S. President Donald Trump and a raft of tech earnings, including iPhone-maker Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Meanwhile, a key gauge of inflation that is closely followed by the Federal Reserve is scheduled to be released, with markets trying to determine the possible path ahead for central bank's monetary policy this year.\n\n1. Futures higher\n\nU.S. stock futures inched higher on Friday, as traders assessed renewed tariff threats from U.S. President Donald Trump and parsed through a batch of earnings from major technology companies.\n\nBy 03:39 ET (08:39 GMT), the Dow futures contract had ticked up by 88 points or 0.2%, S&P futures had risen by 23 points or 0.4%, and Nasdaq 100 futures had advanced by 155 points or 0.7%.\n\nThe main averages on Wall Street climbed in the prior session despite equities paring back some earlier gains following fresh tariff comments from U.S. President Donald Trump (more below). An upbeat outlook from electric vehicle giant Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) helped to offset software titan Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) disappointing guidance for its all-important cloud computing unit.\n\nInvestors were also mulling over statements from executives at Microsoft and Facebook-owner Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) about the emergence of a low-cost artificial intelligence model from Chinese start-up DeepSeek, which roiled global stock markets earlier this week.\n\n2. Trump's fresh tariff threats\n\nTrump has told reporters he would follow through on an earlier threat to slap 25% import tariffs on Canada and Mexico on February 1, arguing that the move was designed to stem the flows of illegal migrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nHe also suggested that he was still planning to place additional levies on China, although he did not provide more details.\n\nIn a later post on Truth Social, Trump warned members of the so-called BRICS group of countries -- Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa -- that they could face 100% duties if they attempt to replace the U.S. dollar as a reserve currency, reiterating a prior threat made in late November.\n\nMarkets have been on edge in recent days as Trump weighs his tariff options.\n\nAlthough he has so far opted not to impose universal levies since his return to the White House, he has threatened actions against specific economies. Some economists have flagged that the tariffs could refuel inflationary pressures in the U.S. and spark a broader trade war -- increasing uncertainty for both businesses and investors.\n\nStory Continues\n\n3. Apple's iPhone outlook\n\nShares in Apple were higher in extended hours trading, rebounding from an initial dip following the iPhone maker's latest quarterly results.\n\nExecutives at the company said the group now expects sales to grow in the low- to mid-single digits in its fiscal second quarter. The guidance surpassed expectations and pointed to momentum in demand for the iPhone, Reuters reported, citing analysts.\n\nThe rosier outlook helped to assuage some worries around sales for Apple's flagship handset, which dropped marginally and missed estimates in its key holiday shopping quarter, due in part to the firm's new AI features not being available in some markets. Still, CEO Tim Cook said the enhancements, known as Apple Intelligence, are boosting sales.\n\nApple has taken a more cautious approach to AI compared to its Silicon Valley peers, choosing not to spend heavily on building out data centers. The strategy seemed to help insulate the stock during the DeepSeek-inspired market turmoil earlier this week, which led to steep drops in other Big Tech shares.\n\n4. PCE ahead\n\nThe release of the December personal consumption expenditures price index is due to highlight the economic calendar on Friday.\n\nEconomists predict the inflation metric will come in at an annualized pace of 2.6% and 0.3% month-on-month, both faster than previous readings of 2.4% and 0.1%.\n\nThe \"core\" measure, meanwhile, is seen at 2.8% year-on-year, matching November's rate, and edging up to 0.2% from 0.1% on a monthly basis.\n\nPolicymakers at the Federal Reserve will likely be assessing the figures as they attempt to gauge the future path of inflation in the world's largest economy. On Wednesday, the Fed left interest rates unchanged at a range of 4.25% to 4.5% and signaled that they would take a wait-and-see attitude to potentially slashing borrowing costs this year, with officials noting lingering uncertainties around the broader economic outlook.\n\n5. Crude set for weekly losses; gold near record peak\n\nOil prices edged higher Friday, but were set for weekly losses as traders fretted over the prospect of trade tariffs under President Trump.\n\nBy 03:40 ET, the US crude futures (WTI) gained 0.2% to $72.88 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.1% to $75.99 a barrel.\n\nFor the week, Brent is set to fall 1.6% while WTI has declined 1.8%. However, for the month of January, Brent is set to gain around 3%, its best month since June, and WTI is poised to climb 2.1%.\n\nElsewhere, gold prices hovered around a record peak as investors eyed Trump's tariff comments and cautiously awaited the upcoming U.S. inflation report.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nFutures higher, Trump's tariff threats, Apple earnings - what's moving markets\n\nEuro zone consumers, forecasters see higher inflation despite ECB optimism\n\nGerman unemployment rate rises with economic malaise\n\nView Comments",

        "headline": "Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) Among Warren Buffett\u2019s Longest-Held Stocks?",
        "content": "We recently published a list of Warren Buffett\u2019s 10 Longest-Held Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks.\n\n\u2018The Oracle of Omaha\u2019\n\nKnown as the Oracle of Omaha, Warren Buffett will undoubtedly go down as one of the greatest and most prosperous value investors in history. During the booming stock market of the 1960s, the billionaire investor used his investment partnership to purchase Berkshire Hathaway, a struggling textile company in New England, which now stands as a global titan.\n\nBuffett has often underlined the need to fully know the internal operations of a company before making any investments. His strategy focuses on finding companies with strong, scalable models that are ready for expansion and market leadership, as well as those that have much to gain from a subsequent increase in stock value. Both investors and market analysts have frequently praised this methodical, long-term investment strategy, particularly in light of Berkshire becoming one of the most recent non-tech companies to reach a $1 trillion market capitalization.\n\nHowever, despite a generally strong market performance for much of 2024, Buffett appears to have shifted towards a more defensive stance. As interest rates climbed and economic conditions weakened, Buffett significantly reduced his holdings in companies experiencing rapid valuation increases. By late 2024, Berkshire had amassed over $325 billion in cash and cash equivalents, predominantly held in U.S. Treasury bills. This suggested that Berkshire avoided making major investments in popular stocks, even during periods of market optimism. That said, Warren Buffett\u2019s decision to hoard cash might not be a random one. In fact, it mirrors strategies he has used in the past during previous financial downturns. As an example, the billionaire adopted a somewhat similar approach at the onset of the dot-com bubble in the early 2000s and again in the lead-up to the 2007-2008 financial crisis. In both these instances, Buffett foresaw market turbulence and positioned Berkshire to navigate the challenges by maintaining substantial liquidity.\n\nWarren Buffett\u2019s Stance on Cryptocurrency\n\nWarren Buffett has repeatedly stated that he is not a fan of cryptocurrency. During Berkshire\u2019s 2018 annual shareholder meeting, Buffett called Bitcoin \u201cprobably rat poison squared.\u201d In Berkshire\u2019s 2022 shareholder meeting, the billionaire once again stated:\n\n\u201cIf you told me you own all of the Bitcoin in the world and you offered it to me for $25, I wouldn\u2019t take it because what would I do with it? I\u2019d have to sell it back to you one way or another. It isn\u2019t going to do anything.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nRecent reports, however, indicate that the Oracle of Omaha seems to be softening his stance on cryptocurrencies. Berkshire has invested in Nu Holdings, a digital banking company based in Brazil that supports the cryptocurrency market and operates its own platform. In a 2021 Series G funding round, Buffett\u2019s company contributed $500 million, followed by another $250 million. Nubank Crypto, Nu\u2019s cryptocurrency platform, was launched in 2022 and supports Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Polygon. Berkshire\u2019s stake in Nu increased from 0.1% in the fourth quarter of 2022 to 0.4% in the third quarter of fiscal 2024.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo create our list of Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks, we analyzed his Q3 2024 investment portfolio and selected stocks that he has consistently held for the longest duration. These figures were sourced from the Insider Monkey Database.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) Among Warren Buffett\u2019s Longest-Held Stocks?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nWarren Buffett\u2019s First Major Purchase: 2016\n\nBerkshire Hathaway\u2019s stake in Q3 2024: $69.9 billion\n\nFew people are unfamiliar with the name Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), the technology giant renowned for its flagship devices, such as the iPhone, Mac, and Apple Watch, as well as its diverse suite of services, such as iCloud and Apple Music. Given the 2.2 billion Apple devices in the world, the company has a significant platform from which to introduce its AI services.\n\nBofA analysts predict that strong initial demand for the iPhone 16 will drive Apple\u2019s fiscal Q1 2025 results on January 30. However, due to fewer iPhone shipments, they expect a lower March quarter guidance. The bank predicts that iPhone sales will fall to 49 million units in the March quarter, less than the street consensus of 52 million and lower than their previous estimate of 56 million. Macroeconomic challenges and the delayed release of Apple Intelligence features, which analysts claim are \u201cyet to gain widespread adoption,\u201d are to blame. BofA reduced its iPhone sales projections for fiscal 2025 and 2026 from 239 million and 257 million units to 229 million and 246 million units, respectively. Despite this, the firm reiterates its Buy rating for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), citing \u201cmargin resiliency, tailwinds to gross margin, and strong cash flow.\u201d\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported $94.9 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2024, representing a 6% increase over the same period the previous year. Product revenue increased from $67 billion to nearly $70 billion in 2023. The company also reported $27 billion in operating cash flow and paid out $29 billion in dividends.\n\nGreenlight Capital stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cWe continue to be concerned about the overall valuation of the market and have maintained a lower-than-average net market exposure. In fact, our daily correlation to the S&P 500 last year was 0.01. Cyclically and interest rate adjusted valuations are as high as we can remember.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 9th on our list of Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

While Buffett's long-term holding is generally positive, the article also highlights concerns about iPhone sales projections and the delayed adoption of Apple Intelligence. The mention of Buffett's large cash holdings and past defensive strategies suggests a cautious market environment, which could limit upside potential. However, the article also mentions a 'Buy' rating from BofA, citing margin resiliency and strong cash flow. Greenlight Capital's comments suggest they see better AI opportunities elsewhere. Overall, the news presents a slightly negative sentiment due to the iPhone sales concerns and the cautious market outlook, but the positive aspects of Buffett's holding and BofA's rating provide some counterbalance. Therefore, a slightly higher probability is assigned to a price fall."

                "reasoning": "The news article focuses on Warren Buffett's long-term holdings and Apple's position within them. While Apple is highlighted as a significant holding for Buffett, the article also presents mixed signals.  Buffett's recent cautious approach to investing, driven by economic uncertainty and rising interest rates, is mentioned.  Furthermore, the article includes a bearish outlook from BofA analysts regarding iPhone sales in the near term, projecting lower-than-expected unit sales.  However, BofA maintains a 'Buy' rating, citing margin resiliency and strong cash flow.  The overall tone is neutral to slightly bearish, with the emphasis on Apple's position within a broader portfolio rather than specific news directly impacting Apple's stock price.  The mention of Apple being only the 9th longest-held stock by Buffett suggests it's not a top priority for him currently.  Therefore, the probability of a price rise is considered lower than the probability of a price fall, but neither is overwhelmingly likely due to the lack of significant new information directly impacting Apple's fundamentals."

Operating Cash Flow: $29.9 billion. Installed Base: Over 2.35 billion active devices, an all-time high. Capital Return: Over $30 billion returned to shareholders, including $23.3 billion in share repurchases.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with FINW.\n\nRelease Date: January 30, 2025\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\n\nPositive Points\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported an all-time high revenue of $124.3 billion for the December quarter, marking a 4% increase year over year. The company achieved all-time revenue records across multiple regions, including the Americas, Europe, Japan, and Asia Pacific, with strong momentum in emerging markets. Services revenue reached an all-time record of $26.3 billion, growing 14% year over year, with significant growth in both developed and emerging markets. Apple's installed base of active devices reached a new record of over 2.35 billion, driven by high customer satisfaction and loyalty. The introduction of Apple Intelligence features has been well-received, contributing to stronger iPhone sales in markets where it is available.\n\nNegative Points\n\nGreater China revenue declined by 11% year over year, with over half of the decline attributed to changes in channel inventory. Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue decreased by 2% year over year, facing challenges compared to the previous year's product launches. Foreign exchange headwinds are expected to negatively impact revenue by about 2.5 percentage points in the upcoming quarter. The company faces competitive pressures in China, where Apple Intelligence has not yet been rolled out, affecting iPhone replacement cycles. Operating expenses increased by 7% year over year, reaching $15.4 billion, which may impact future profitability if not managed effectively.\n\nQ & A Highlights\n\nQ: Tim, can you elaborate on how Apple Intelligence is impacting iPhone demand and which features are most popular? A: We observed stronger year-over-year performance for the iPhone 16 family in markets where Apple Intelligence was available. Popular features include writing tools, Image Playground, Genmoji, and visual intelligence. Clean Up is also well-received, especially in-store demos.\n\nStory Continues\n\nQ: Can you discuss the challenges Apple faces in China, particularly regarding iPhone sales? A: Greater China revenue was down 11% year-over-year, with over half of the decline due to changes in channel inventory. Apple Intelligence has not been rolled out in China, which affects performance. The market remains highly competitive, and recent fiscal stimulus could impact future results.\n\nQ: How does Apple view the potential for innovation in iPhone form factors in the future? A: We believe there is significant room for innovation in smartphones, and we are optimistic about our product pipeline. We expect continued advancements in form factors and features.\n\nQ: What is driving the strong upgrade cycle for iPhones, and has Apple Intelligence played a role? A: We set an all-time record for iPhone upgraders, with compelling reasons to upgrade. The iPhone 16 outperformed the 15 from launch to the end of the December quarter, and Apple Intelligence contributed to stronger performance in markets where it was available.\n\nQ: Can you comment on the sustainability of growth in emerging markets and their potential to offset China headwinds? A: We see robust growth in emerging markets, particularly in India, which set a December quarter record. The iPhone was the top-selling model in India, and we are expanding our retail presence there. Emerging markets offer significant upside potential.\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

The overall positive growth in key segments like iPhone and Services, along with a record number of active devices, suggests strong market demand.

However, the company is addressing the China issue and seeing strong growth in other emerging markets. The positive impact of Apple Intelligence on iPhone sales is also a significant factor.

The decline in Greater China revenue, attributed partly to inventory adjustments but also to competitive pressures and the lack of Apple Intelligence rollout there, is a significant concern.  The decrease in Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue also presents a downside risk.  Offsetting these negatives is the strong performance of the iPhone, driven partly by Apple Intelligence, and robust growth in emerging markets.  The high installed base and continued strong Services revenue are also positive indicators.  Overall, the positive aspects outweigh the negatives, but the risks associated with the China market and potential future expense management issues suggest a less than certain upward trajectory.  The probability of a price rise is higher, but not overwhelmingly so, given the existing uncertainties."

The introduction of Apple Intelligence features has been well-received, contributing to stronger iPhone sales in certain markets. However, there are notable negatives, including a decline in Greater China revenue, a slight drop in Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue, and foreign exchange headwinds expected to impact future revenue.

        "content": "We recently published a list of 10 AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other AI stocks on latest news and ratings.\n\nElon Musk recently sparked skepticism in the AI community by claiming that companies funding the Stargate initiative lack the funds to do so. The Stargate initiative is a $500 billion artificial intelligence project recently announced by President Donald Trump. The project aims to build new AI data centers in the US.\n\nThree prominent figures in the initiative are SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son who will handle the financing, CEO Sam Altman of OpenAI who will be contributing his overall AI expertise, and Oracle executive chairman Larry Ellison who will oversee the buildout. All three joined President Trump on January 21 when he made the Stargate announcement.\n\nREAD NOW: 10 AI Stocks Making Waves on Wall Streetand\u00a010 AI Stocks to Watch Amid the DeepSeek Buzz\n\nMusk has claimed that this initiative doesn\u2019t have the necessary funding in place, which in turn sparked a dispute between him and Sam Altman. Altman has refuted Musk\u2019s claim, asserting that the funding is in place and that the work has already started. Larry Ellison, in particular, has noted that 10 data centers, each 500,000 square feet, are already under construction in Abilene, Texas, and that 10 more are in the pipeline.\n\nMusk is currently leading Trump\u2019s new government efficiency advisory board, DOGE. He also shares a tense relationship with Altman and is engaged in an ongoing lawsuit with OpenAI. In response to Musk\u2019s claims, Trump answered questions from reporters at the White House, dismissing the criticism. Trump was asked if Musk\u2019s criticism of the deal was a bother to him.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t. He hates one of the people in the deal,\u201d Trump said of Musk. \u201cPeople in the deal are very, very smart people. But, Elon, one of the people he happens to hate. I have certain hatreds of people, too\u201d.\n\nRegarding the claims regarding the insufficient funding, Trump said that he doesn\u2019t know but he hopes that they do.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if they do, but you know, they\u2019re putting up the money. The government\u2019s not putting up anything, they\u2019re putting up money. They\u2019re very rich people, so I hope they do\u201d.\n\nA Trump adviser also wondered whether the public dispute may imply an end for Trump and Musk.\n\n\u201cThe end may be in sight,\u201d the adviser said.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Apple Inc. (AAPL) Is Struggling to Innovate in AI\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that has recently launched Apple Intelligence, its intelligence system. One of the biggest analyst calls on Wednesday, January 29, was for Apple Inc. Oppenheimer downgraded the stock to \u201cPerform\u201d from \u201cOutperform\u201d and removed its $250 price target on the stock. The ratings, issued ahead of its earnings on January 29, quoted a \u201cweaker outlook\u201d for iPhone sales in the next 12 to 18 months, a lack of AI innovation, and challenges in the Chinese market. The analyst also expects a slower-than-expected iPhone replacement cycle heading into fiscal 2026. In this period, he sees just 2% shipment growth. The analyst noted the gradual rollout of Apple Intelligence, Apple\u2019s lack of generative AI apps for consumers, and the advancements in capabilities from other AI models to cause this slow growth. Due to these reasons, the analyst believes it will be difficult for Apple to outperform.\n\n\u201cWe see little upside to Apple\u2019s valuation and believe it is hard to justify its premium multiple with slower iPhone growth and Apple\u2019s uncertain role in the early stages of gen AI adoption among consumers\u201d.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of AI stocks on latest news and ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

                "reasoning": "The news highlights concerns about Apple's struggle to innovate in AI, coupled with a downgrade from Oppenheimer due to weaker iPhone sales outlook and slower iPhone replacement cycles. These factors could lead to investor concerns and potential sell-offs. However, Apple remains a strong brand with a significant base of hedge fund holders, which may provide some stability. Overall, the negative tone of the news leans towards a higher likelihood of a stock price decline."

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. gave a reassuring revenue forecast for the current quarter, helping boost shares of the world\u2019s most valuable company after its holiday results showed jarring declines for China and the iPhone.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nManhattan\u2019s Morning Commute Time Drops With New Congestion Toll How the 2025 Catholic Jubilee Is Reshaping Rome Trump Paves the Way to Deputize Local Police on Immigration Housing Aid Uncertain After Trump\u2019s Spending Freeze Memo Trump's Federal Funding Pause Threatens State Financials\n\nSales will grow by a percentage in the low- to mid-single digits, the company said during a conference call Thursday. Though that\u2019s in line with the roughly 5% that analysts have been predicting, it was enough to soothe the nerves of investors following a mixed quarterly report.\n\nThe shares climbed more than 3% in late trading, rebounding from a decrease. They had dropped 5.1% this year through the close, part of a broader tech stock decline.\n\nRevenue from China plunged 11% to $18.5 billion in the fiscal first quarter, which ended Dec. 28, Apple said earlier. Analysts had anticipated a gain to $21.6 billion. Sales of the iPhone, meanwhile, dropped less than 1% to $69.1 billion. Wall Street projected $71 billion.\n\nThe results renewed concerns about China, one of Apple\u2019s biggest markets, where it\u2019s struggled to fend off competition from local brands. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said that more than half of the decline in China stemmed from inventory issues.\n\n\u201cOur channel inventory reduced from the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter,\u201d he said during the conference call. \u201cOur sales were a bit higher than we forecasted them to be toward the end of the quarter. And so we ended a little leaner than we had expected to.\u201d\n\nThe poor performance for overall iPhone sales suggested that the company didn\u2019t get much of a lift from the rollout of a new AI platform, Apple Intelligence. Still, the new iPhone 16 performed better in countries where the AI features were available, Cook said.\n\nApple is playing catch-up with its biggest tech peers in AI. A staggered rollout of Apple Intelligence also has meant that consumers have had to wait for many features. And competitors have jumped out ahead in other areas, such as smart glasses. Apple\u2019s wearables business declined over the holidays as well.\n\n\u201cApple needs to accelerate its Apple Intelligence deployment and be a bit more aggressive in emerging areas like smart glasses development to maintain an innovative edge,\u201d Emarketer analyst Jacob Bourne said in a note. \u201cThe next few quarters will test whether it can balance its cautious approach with the market\u2019s hunger for AI innovation.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe report also marks a changing of the guard for Apple. It\u2019s the first to be announced under new Chief Financial Officer Kevan Parekh, who replaced longtime CFO Luca Maestri at the beginning of this year.\n\nTotal revenue rose 4% to $124.3 billion in the period, helped by growth in services revenue. Analysts had projected $124.1 billion on average. Profit rose to $2.40 a share, beating the average estimate of $2.35. Like the revenue figure, that number was a record high.\n\nThe latest iPhones aren\u2019t markedly different than the prior models \u2014 a factor that may have led some consumers to hold off on upgrades. Though the company has touted the Apple Intelligence platform as a reason to buy the device, its earlier iPhone 15 Pro models can also run the software.\n\nApple is planning a larger iPhone refresh this year, including a replacement for its low-end SE model in the coming months and a thinner iPhone in the fall.\n\nThe services division, which includes the App Store and Apple Music, was a bright spot, bringing in an all-time record of $26.3 billion and growing 14%. Wall Street had been looking for $26.1 billion. Services revenue in the second quarter will climb in the low-single digits, Apple said during the call.\n\nThe Mac and iPad lineups also performed better than expected. The Mac generated sales of $8.99 billion in the quarter, beating estimates of $7.94 billion.\n\nApple updated several models with AI-focused M4 chips last year, and it plans to roll out a new MacBook Air soon. It\u2019s also expected to unveil desktop computers later in the year.\n\nRevenue from the iPad grew 15% to $8.09 billion, compared with an estimate of $7.35 billion. After taking a break in 2023 from launching new models, the company revamped the iPad Pro and iPad Air last May and refreshed the iPad mini in the fall. Cook said the new Air and lower-end models were mainly responsible for the revenue increase. The company is planning to update the low-end and Air models in the coming months.\n\nThe company\u2019s wearables, home and accessories category, which has struggled in recent quarters, posted revenue of about $11.8 billion. That was down slightly from a year earlier and below the projection of nearly $12 billion.\n\nThe company released a redesigned Apple Watch Series 10 and rolled out two new AirPods models last year, but its latest product category \u2014 the Vision Pro headset \u2014 hasn\u2019t been a sales driver. Parekh said the lack of a new Ultra watch in 2024 created a tough comparison for that segment.\n\nMore broadly, Cupertino, California-based Apple still faces plenty of challenges at home and internationally.\n\nIts struggles in China have stemmed in part from not being able to offer Apple Intelligence in the country. That\u2019s made it harder to compete with local brands like Huawei Technologies Co. Apple is working to find an AI partner that will let it launch the AI platform in China.\n\nIn the EU, where Apple\u2019s AI won\u2019t be offered to customers until April, the company is facing continued scrutiny over the dominance of its App Store. The company is under threat of fines if it doesn\u2019t concede to regulators and change policies, including those related to subscription payments, that could weigh on its services results.\n\nLocally, the company is bracing for the possibility of new tariffs during the second Trump administration. President Donald Trump has discussed imposing the levies on goods imported into the US from China and elsewhere. Right now, Apple makes the majority of its processors in Taiwan via partner Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., while most of its devices are assembled in China.\n\nAsked about the possibility of tariffs, Cook said Apple is \u201cmonitoring the situation.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s biggest hurdle may be in artificial intelligence, where it remains behind many of its tech peers. Apple Intelligence \u2014 introduced in stages over a period of months \u2014 has suffered from bugs, including inaccurate news summaries. And the homegrown features pale in comparison with offerings from OpenAI, Google Gemini and the emerging DeepSeek.\n\nCook praised DeepSeek during the call, but said that Apple\u2019s approach would still give it an advantage.\n\n\u201cInnovation that drives efficiency is a good thing,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd, that\u2019s what you see in that model. Our tight integration of silicon and software, I think, will continue to serve us very well.\u201d\n\n(Updates with further remarks from call starting in sixth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIndy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans The Internet Almost Killed Barnes & Noble, Then Saved It What America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments",

However, the positive outlook for the current quarter, projecting low-to-mid single-digit revenue growth, calmed investor concerns.  The 3% after-hours jump suggests immediate positive market reaction to the forecast. While challenges remain, including competition in China, AI development lags, and potential tariffs, the beat on earnings per share and the strong performance of services revenue provide a counterbalance. The overall picture is cautiously optimistic, with the positive forecast outweighing the negative aspects of the report in the short term.

Additionally, Apple's services division, Mac, and iPad lineups performed better than expected, contributing to record high revenue and profit. However, there were several negative aspects, including a significant decline in revenue from China (11%), poor iPhone sales (dropped less than 1%), and struggles in the wearables and accessories segment. The company also faces challenges in AI, where it is playing catch-up with competitors, and regulatory scrutiny in the EU. Despite these challenges, the immediate market reaction was positive, with shares climbing more than 3% in late trading. Given the mixed nature of the news but the positive immediate market reaction and the comforting guidance, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall."

The reported sales of $69.1 billion fell short of analyst expectations of $70.7 billion, suggesting weaker demand than anticipated. Although total revenue increased by almost 4%, the focus on iPhone sales and the mention of AI not yet contributing to growth may lead to investor concerns about future performance. This combination of a sales miss and cautious sentiment regarding AI could result in a higher probability of the stock price falling rather than rising."

The market's reaction will likely depend on investor sentiment regarding Apple's AI strategy and future growth prospects. The fact that AI payoff is 'awaited' suggests uncertainty. Given the slight miss on iPhone sales and the reliance on future AI performance, a slightly negative reaction is more probable. However, the overall revenue growth provides some buffer against a significant drop."

While overall revenue was up, the iPhone shortfall is significant because it's Apple's most valuable product.  The news highlights the market's anticipation of AI-driven growth, which hasn't yet materialized. This is a mixed signal.  The slight revenue increase and the overall positive outlook for AI integration in the future could mitigate the negative impact of the missed iPhone sales target. However, the market's reaction will depend on how investors weigh the short-term miss against the long-term AI potential.  A slight negative reaction is more likely in the short term due to the missed expectations, but the overall positive revenue growth and future AI prospects suggest the fall won't be drastic. "

This could be perceived negatively by investors, as it suggests that the company's most valuable product may not be experiencing the growth expected, particularly in relation to its artificial intelligence (AI) initiatives. However, it's worth noting that total revenue still managed to rise almost 4% from the same quarter last year, which might mitigate some negative perceptions. Given these mixed signals, the probability of the stock price rising might be lower due to the miss on iPhone sales and the awaited but not yet realized impact of AI on growth. Conversely, the probability of the stock price falling could be higher because the slight decline in iPhone sales and the revenue miss could lead to negative investor sentiment. However, the overall financial performance is still positive, which might limit downside."

This mixed performance suggests that while the decline in iPhone sales might negatively impact investor sentiment, the overall revenue growth could mitigate the negative effects. Given this, the probability of the stock price falling due to the decline in iPhone sales is higher than the probability of it rising solely based on the revenue growth. However, since the decline in iPhone sales is only slight and the company's overall revenue is still growing, the impact on the stock price might not be significantly negative."

However, the significant decline in Greater China revenue (-11.1%) is a concern. While Europe, Japan, and Americas showed growth, the China decline could weigh on investor sentiment. iPhone revenue was slightly below expectations, while Mac and iPad revenue showed strong growth. Services continue to be a strong point. The Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell) suggests underperformance in the near term. Considering these factors, the positive earnings surprise is somewhat offset by the negative signals, leading to a slightly higher probability of a price fall than rise."

However, a closer look at the key metrics reveals a mixed performance. While Services revenue showed strong growth (+13.9% YoY), and some product lines like Mac and iPad performed well, iPhone sales were slightly below expectations and other segments like Wearables underperformed.  Geographic revenue showed varied results, with strong growth in Europe and Japan but weakness in Greater China. The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) rating further suggests a negative outlook.  Considering the mixed results and the negative Zacks rating, the probability of a price rise is lower than the probability of a price fall. The slight beat on overall earnings and EPS is not strong enough to overcome the other negative factors."

While the company exceeded consensus estimates for both revenue and EPS, with slight surprises of +0.24% and +1.69% respectively, there are notable regional and product segment variances. Greater China revenue fell significantly short of estimates (-11.1% year-over-year), which could be a concern given its importance to Apple's growth. Conversely, Europe, Japan, and the Americas showed strong performance. Product segments like Mac and iPad outperformed, while iPhone and Wearables underperformed. The Services segment continued its strong growth. Despite the overall positive earnings surprise, the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and recent underperformance (-4.4% over the past month) suggest caution. The market may react negatively to the China weakness and mixed product segment results, offsetting the positive earnings surprise."

The mixed performance across different geographic regions and product segments, including a significant decline in Greater China revenue (-11.1% year-over-year) and a drop in Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue (-1.7% year-over-year), could be concerning for investors.

This is a classic case of a mixed bag.  The positive earnings beat suggests investor confidence in Apple's overall financial health and the growth of its services business. However, the decline in iPhone sales, a key revenue driver, is a negative factor that could weigh on the stock price. The fact that the stock rose in extended trading *after* the earnings release suggests that the market initially reacted more positively to the earnings beat than negatively to the iPhone sales decline.  However, this initial positive reaction might not be sustained.  Therefore, I assign a higher probability to a price rise, but acknowledge the risk of a price fall due to the iPhone sales decline.

While Cook acknowledges the varying product lifecycles and highlights the 'huge opportunity' from units sold during the Covid period, his response lacks a concrete strategy to address the potential decline in sales if the refresh cycle is indeed lengthening. This ambiguity could be interpreted negatively by investors, leading to uncertainty about future revenue growth. However, Cook's emphasis on 'huge opportunity' provides some counter-balance, suggesting potential growth areas. Considering these factors, there's a slightly higher probability of a stock price fall due to the uncertainty surrounding the refresh cycle, but the potential for growth mitigates the risk somewhat."

However, Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, downplayed this concern, emphasizing the large number of iPhones sold during the COVID period and the resulting upgrade opportunity.  This suggests a cautious optimism from Apple's leadership. While the missing refresh cycle could indicate weaker near-term sales, the potential for upgrades from older devices and the overall positive outlook expressed by Cook mitigate the negative impact.  The market's reaction will likely depend on how investors weigh these competing factors. A neutral to slightly positive reaction is more probable than a significant negative one, given Apple's overall strong position and Cook's comments."

Apple reported earnings per share of $2.41, and net income of $36.3 billion.\n\n\u201cToday Apple is reporting our best quarter ever, with revenue of $124.3 billion, up 4 percent from a year ago,\u201d Apple chief executive Tim Cook said in a statement. \u201cWe were thrilled to bring customers our best-ever lineup of products and services during the holiday season. Through the power of Apple silicon, we\u2019re unlocking new possibilities for our users with Apple Intelligence, which makes apps and experiences even better and more personal.\u201d\n\nThe company was expected to report revenues of $124.3 billion for the fiscal first quarter, according to analysts\u2019 estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS). Apple was also expected to report earnings of $2.35 per share for the quarter ended in December, and net income of $35.6 billion.\n\nDespite being the company\u2019s \u201cbest quarter ever,\u201d Apple missed iPhone revenue expectations. The tech giant reported $69.1 billion in net sales for the iPhone, while analysts had expected $70.7 billion, according to FactSet.\n\nApple shares were up by more than 3% in after-hours trading after the company said on its earnings call it expects \u201clow to mid single digits\u201d growth on an annual basis for the March quarter. Analysts expected guidance of $95.6 billion for revenue, and $1.66 for earnings per share, according to FactSet\n\nThe company\u2019s shares were down 0.74% at the market close on Thursday, and are down by 5.1% so far this year.\n\nCook said on Apple\u2019s earnings call it will roll out more languages for Apple Intelligence in April, and that most customers are currently using artificial intelligence features such as Writing Tools and Image Playground.\n\nEarlier this month, Jefferies (JEF) analysts downgraded Apple\u2019s rating to \u201cUnderperform,\u201d citing expectations of a miss for both fiscal first-quarter results and guidance. Apple\u2019s iPhone 17 and 18 sales are expected to \u201cbe weak,\u201d Jefferies said, \u201cbecause there are limited hardware upgrades to drive adoption.\u201d\n\nThe company rolled out the Apple Intelligence features in October, which \u201chas yet to gain traction with consumers,\u201d Jefferies analysts said.\n\nFollowing Asia supply chain checks, Jefferies said it was \u201ccautious\u201d over demand for Apple\u2019s rumored iPhone SE 4, which it said is likely to launch toward the end of March. The rumored smartphone \u2014 part of the SE series of smaller iPhones \u2014 is expected to use an A18 chip that is also found in the iPhone 16, a full-screen OLED display, and have Apple Intelligence capabilities.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nVer comentarios",

While the company reported record earnings and beat overall revenue and EPS expectations, it missed iPhone revenue estimates, which is a significant concern given the iPhone's importance to Apple's overall performance. The initial after-hours trading surge suggests a positive reaction to the overall earnings and forward guidance, but the miss on iPhone revenue and the Jefferies downgrade introduce uncertainty. The 'low to mid single digits' growth guidance for the March quarter is decent but not spectacular. The rollout of Apple Intelligence and its adoption rate are also factors to consider. Considering these factors, the market reaction is likely to be volatile. The positive aspects (record earnings, overall beat, guidance) are balanced by the negative (iPhone miss, downgrade, AI adoption concerns). Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a price rise due to the initial positive reaction and overall earnings beat, but the iPhone miss and downgrade temper this optimism."

The positive aspect is the record earnings and positive guidance for low-to-mid single-digit growth in the next quarter. This suggests continued growth, albeit at a slower pace.  The negative aspect is the iPhone sales miss and the Jefferies downgrade citing concerns about weak iPhone 17/18 sales and slow adoption of Apple Intelligence. The after-hours trading increase of over 3% following the earnings call suggests the market initially reacted positively to the overall record earnings and future guidance. However, the pre-earnings market close showed a decline, indicating some pre-existing negative sentiment. Considering these mixed signals, the probability of a price rise is slightly higher due to the record earnings and positive guidance, but the concerns about iPhone sales and the Jefferies downgrade temper this optimism."

However, Apple missed iPhone revenue estimates ($69.1 billion vs. $70.7 billion expected), which could be a concern given the iPhone's significance to Apple's revenue. Additionally, Jefferies downgraded Apple due to weak expectations for future iPhone sales and limited traction with Apple Intelligence features. The stock's year-to-date decline of 5.1% and the mixed reaction to the earnings report suggest uncertainty.

However, the current flagging situation in China might cause temporary investor concerns. Overall, the emphasis on growth opportunities in emerging markets is likely to have a positive impact on investor sentiment."

        "content": "Apple (AAPL) came out with quarterly earnings of $2.40 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.36 per share. This compares to earnings of $2.18 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 1.69%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products would post earnings of $1.49 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.64, delivering a surprise of 10.07%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nApple , which belongs to the Zacks Computer - Micro Computers industry, posted revenues of $124.3 billion for the quarter ended December 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.24%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $119.58 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nApple shares have lost about 4.4% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 2.7%.\n\nWhat's Next for Apple?\n\nWhile Apple has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Apple: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.65 on $94.97 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $7.34 on $410.19 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nStory Continues\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Computer - Micro Computers is currently in the bottom 28% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nOne other stock from the same industry, Dell Technologies (DELL), is yet to report results for the quarter ended January 2025. The results are expected to be released on February 26.\n\nThis computer and technology services provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.51 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +14.1%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nDell Technologies' revenues are expected to be $24.66 billion, up 10.5% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The overall industry outlook is also weak, being in the bottom 28% of Zacks industries.

The Zacks Rank is currently #4 (Sell), indicating an expectation of underperformance. The estimate revisions trend was unfavorable ahead of the earnings release. Additionally, Apple has underperformed the S&P 500 year-to-date, and the Computer - Micro Computers industry is in the bottom 28% of Zacks industries. The sustainability of the stock's price movement depends heavily on management's commentary during the earnings call, which is not yet available.

However, the direct impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal. The fact that Amazon was down 1% in recent trading despite the news suggests the market isn't reacting strongly to this development. The news is more about Amazon's strategy and X's potential recovery than a direct catalyst for Apple's stock. Therefore, the probability of a significant rise or fall in Apple's stock price due to this specific news is relatively low. The market's reaction to Amazon's news is a good indicator of how this type of news is perceived."

The news is indirect and doesn't provide any substantial information about Apple's financial performance or future prospects.  The probability of a stock price movement is therefore likely to be close to neutral, slightly favoring no change due to the indirect nature of the news.  Amazon's 1% drop is unrelated to Apple's potential ad spending on X."

While the news is more directly relevant to Amazon (AMZN), the mention of Apple (AAPL) considering ad tests on X could be seen as a neutral to slightly positive signal, indicating potential new revenue streams or marketing strategies. However, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely minimal since the news is not directly about Apple's core business or financial performance. The broader context of companies returning to X under Musk's leadership may also be viewed with caution due to past controversies. Given the indirect nature of the news for Apple, the probability of a significant stock price movement is low."

Given that the news is more directly related to Amazon and not Apple, and there is no specific information that would negatively or positively impact Apple's business, the probabilities of Apple's stock price rising or falling due to this news are relatively neutral. The mention of Apple is minor and does not provide clear direction for stock movement."

However, the article does not provide a direct link between this news and Apple's stock price. Considering the indirect impact of this news on Apple, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising due to potential increased advertising revenue and a low probability of the stock price falling as the news does not seem to have a negative impact on Apple."

This mixed sentiment creates uncertainty. Since the report is pending, the market's reaction will depend on the actual results and guidance.

        "headline": "Futures higher; tech earnings in focus; Fed decision - what's moving markets",
        "content": "Investing.com - U.S. stock futures climb following fresh quarterly reports from a slew of Big Tech companies, including Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). Executives at these firms back a spike in artificial intelligence spending despite worries over the strategy in the wake of the emergence of a cut-price Chinese AI model earlier this week. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) aims to reduce costs and roll out a new, cheaper electric vehicle this year to combat flagging demand, while the Fed opts to take a wait-and-see approach to future policy moves.\n\n1. Futures higher\n\nU.S. stock futures ticked higher on Thursday, as investors assessed a raft of earnings from mega-cap tech companies and poured over monetary policy comments from the Federal Reserve.\n\nBy 03:55 ET (08:55 GMT), the Dow futures contract had gained 162 points or 0.4%, S&P 500 futures had risen by 31 points or 0.5%, and Nasdaq 100 futures had advanced by 168 points or 0.8%.\n\nThe main averages on Wall Street all slipped in the prior session following the Fed's widely-anticipated decision to press pause on a series of borrowing cost cuts. Policymakers also signaled that they will take a wait-and-see attitude to any potential reductions in the future, pushing up US government bond yields and denting equities (more below).\n\nStocks were also pulled lower by technology shares, including artificial intelligence-darling Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), which dropped by 4.1%. The slide came two days after a global sell-off sparked by the emergence of a low-cost AI model from Chinese start-up DeepSeek that raised questions over major tech groups' massive AI spending plans.\n\n2. Microsoft, Meta CEOs on DeepSeek\n\nDespite these concerns, executives at software giant Microsoft and Facebook-owner Meta Platforms moved to defend the spending as a way to maintain competitiveness in the race to monetize AI.\n\nThe rise in popularity of DeepSeek's free AI model was a key issue for analysts as they parsed through quarterly returns from these companies. DeepSeek has said it built the model using less-advanced chips and for only around $6 million, a claim that has been sharply questioned but has still fueled worries around the necessity of the billions of dollars in AI investments being pursued by American tech giants.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella told analysts in a post-earnings call that AI costs are decreasing, while Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg argued that shelling out heavily on capital expenditures will prove to be a \"strategic advantage\" over time.\n\nShares in Microsoft fell in extended hours trading after the company's third-quarter outlook for its crucial Azure cloud computing unit disappointed expectations.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeta's stock price, on the other hand, rose after-hours on better-than-estimated fourth-quarter revenue, although it flagged that current-quarter sales may not meet expectations.\n\n3. Tesla pushes to slash costs, roll out cheaper EV model\n\nElectric vehicle giant Tesla noted that it was driving to slash costs and roll out a cheaper EV model, giving lift to its shares in extended hours dealmaking.\n\nTesla, which logged a decline in deliveries last year, said it is moving to launch its new low-cost EV in the first half of 2025 in a bid to help boost demand. CEO Elon Musk has previously projected that vehicle sales would grow by 20% to 30% this year, although the company did not reiterate the estimate in its latest earnings.\n\nTesla added that the average cost for constructing its cars hit an all-time low in the fourth quarter thanks in part to falling raw material expenses.\n\nQuarterly profit margin from vehicle sales, stripping out regulatory credits, came in at 13.59%, according to calculations from Reuters. Wall Street analysts had seen the figure at 16.2%, Reuters added, citing Visible Alpha data. Tesla has offered less expensive financing to support demand, but analysts have flagged that this could eat into margins.\n\nElsewhere, Musk said Tesla would begin testing a paid autonomous vehicle service in June. He has targeted Tesla's driver assistance software, as well as AI, as key sources of support for the business in the future.\n\n4. Apple to report\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is due to report after the bell on Thursday, with the iPhone manufacturer tipped to unveil tepid quarterly revenue growth.\n\nThe California tech group has faced intensifying competition in its major Chinese market, possibly denting sales during the holiday shopping period.\n\nIt has also been slowly introducing AI-enhanced features on its handsets. An improved version of its Siri voice assistant is not expected to be available until later this year in some regions, while initial reviews for its Apple Intelligence offering have received \"mixed-to-poor reviews\", analysts at Vital Knowledge said.\n\nThe analysts also flagged in a note to clients that the lukewarm reception to Apple Intelligence may suggest that the product \"won't be a huge driver of iPhone sales\".\n\nHowever, Apple is still less exposed to the emergence of DeepSeek's AI model than its other Big Tech peers who have invested heavily in AI, according to analysts at Baird.\n\nIn a note to clients, the analysts said the firm, as a \"leading\" manufacturer of consumer-facing products, is \"well-positioned\" to benefit from so-called generative AI \"without spending tens of billions of dollars on large language models or infrastructure\".\n\nApple said fiscal fourth-quarter payments for property and equipment -- a gauge of capital expenditures -- rose by $2.91 billion to $9.45 billion. The amount was relatively more modest than the plans put forward by rivals like Microsoft and Meta Platforms, partly because Apple uses third-party data centers for some of its AI work.\n\n5. Fed leaves rates steady; ECB decision ahead\n\nThe Fed held interest rates steady at a range of 4.25% to 4.5% on Wednesday, while Chair Jerome Powell said officials were in no rush to cut borrowing costs again.\n\nUnderpinned by a recent set of solid U.S. economic data and lingering uncertainties surrounding the wider outlook, officials chose to place monetary policy on a holding pattern.\n\nHowever, decisions on tariffs, taxes, and immigration by the new Trump administration could factor once again into the Fed's plans. Some economists have predicted the moves could place renewed upward pressure on inflation, which remains above the Fed's stated 2% target level.\n\nSpeaking in a press conference, Powell said he believed the Fed had a \"very well-calibrated\" policy stance supported by a \"broadly stable\" employment picture and \"more positive\" inflation readings. As such, the Fed sees no cause to adjust rates again until data shows risks to the job market or a fresh drop in inflation.\n\nPowell added that the Fed's calls were not motivated by politics -- a comment that came after Trump criticized the central bank and urged policymakers to cut rates.\n\nElsewhere, the European Central Bank is expected to slash rates on Thursday as policymakers look to revive sluggish economic activity in the Eurozone currency area. The ECB previously lowered rates four times in 2024, noting that a steep climb in inflation in recent years was almost finished.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nFutures higher; tech earnings in focus; Fed decision - what's moving markets\n\nFinland's Nordea Bank just beats Q4 estimates on \"slow\" lending market recovery\n\nExclusive-Thailand's economy may underperform from weak consumption, warns central bank chief\n\nView Comments",

        "content": "We recently published a list of the 12 Best Stocks to Buy in 2025 for Beginners. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other best beginner stocks to buy in 2025.\n\nStock Market Outlook for 2025\n\nOn December 12, Tom Lee, Fundstrat Global Advisors managing partner and head of research, appeared on CNBC to talk about his 2025 playbook. After two years of significant market gains, Lee\u2019s playbook painted an optimistic yet cautious outlook for the stock market in 2025. He anticipated that the S&P 500 would rise to approximately 7,000 by mid-2025 before retreating to around 6,600 by the end of the year. This highlights an overall expected increase of about 8% for the year, consistent with historical averages for stock market returns.\n\nFurthermore, Lee estimated the Earnings Per Share (EPS) for the S&P 500 to be around $260 in 2025, going up to $300 in 2026. These numbers are slightly below the Wall Street consensus estimates, which show an average of around $268 for 2025. Talking about his investment thesis, Lee believed several themes could bring a positive trajectory in the market in 2025. In his own Dickensian version, he predicted a \u201ctale of two halves,\u201d where the first half of 2025 is expected to see strong market performance, with a potential pullback in the second half. The positive first-half performance is attributed to factors such as market-friendly initiatives under President Trump\u2019s administration and Federal Reserve policies. The pullback in the second half of 2025 reflects historical trends after strong consecutive years.\n\nREAD ALSO: 12 Undervalued Defensive Stocks for 2025 and 10 Best Soaps and Cleaning Materials Stocks to Invest In.\n\nMega Cap Companies: Is There Potential?\n\nLee was of the opinion that the small-cap sector may have potential even though it has historically underperformed relative to large-cap stocks. He also talked about mega-cap companies and how they\u2019re leading, mentioning that investors typically reach for these companies when there is even a possibility of risk in the market. In addition, mega-cap stocks are highly sensitive to falling interest rates. Since the tech market is bullish after the December rate cut is in effect, the investment case for megacaps is further strengthening.\n\nHowever, despite an overall positive outlook, Lee acknowledged that several risks may impact market performance. For instance, he was of the view that the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) could potentially lead to reduced government spending and slower economic growth if it is too effective in cutting costs. Furthermore, the implementation of tariffs poses another concern, as tariffs can adversely affect corporate profits and financial conditions.

Apple has a history of focusing on integrating AI subtly into its existing products rather than making it a major marketing point.  DeepSeek's validation of this approach suggests that Apple's strategy might be effective.  The massive AI spending by competitors like Meta carries significant risk;  Apple's more measured approach could be seen as fiscally responsible and less prone to large write-downs.  Therefore, the impact of this news on Apple's stock price is likely to be muted.  A slight negative reaction is possible due to the prevailing narrative around the importance of large AI investments, but the overall effect is expected to be minimal.

While a 1.4% increase isn't necessarily negative, it's significantly below what many investors might hope for from a company like Apple.  This subdued growth forecast increases the likelihood of a negative market reaction if the actual results fall short of or only slightly exceed this prediction. Conversely, if Apple surpasses expectations significantly, the stock price could rise. However, given the context of already low growth expectations, the probability of a significant positive surprise is considered lower than the probability of a negative surprise or meeting expectations, which would likely be viewed as disappointing."

This suggests stagnation in a key revenue driver, which could disappoint investors and lead to negative sentiment. However, Apple's earnings reports often include other factors (e.g., services growth, margins, guidance) that could offset this. Given the focus on weak iPhone growth, the market reaction is likely skewed slightly negative, but not overwhelmingly so."

This low growth projection, combined with iPhone sales being a significant portion of Apple's revenue, could lead to a neutral or negative market reaction. Historically, when growth expectations are low, and actual results do not exceed these modest projections, stock prices tend to react negatively. However, the market has already priced in these expectations to some extent, and if Apple's earnings report meets or slightly exceeds these modest expectations, the stock price might see a less severe decline or even a slight rise due to relief. Given these considerations, the probability of the stock price rising seems lower than the probability of it falling, but still, there is a chance for a positive surprise if Apple's ecosystem, services, or other product lines show significant growth."

He reminded the audience that the sector was now worth 150% of the economy\u2019s gross domestic product.\n\nThe RBA is working with regulators to \u201cthink through different scenarios where you could potentially have a multitude of shocks\u201d come together, said Jones, who oversees the financial system at the central bank. The \u201cinterconnectedness in the system is much higher than it was 15 years ago during the global financial crisis.\u201d\n\nThe central bank has previously warned the surging growth of the nation\u2019s pensions industry has created new risks to the stability of the country\u2019s financial system. Potential scenarios could include a large market shock that undermines confidence, an unexpected change in policy settings or a cyber attack, Jones said Thursday.\n\nThose risks were amplified by pension funds \u2014 known as superannuation \u2014 holding far more short-term bank debt than during the global financial crisis, Jones said. Then, they \u201ccollectively owned about 5% of short term bank debt\u201d whereas it now stands at somewhere between 35%-45%, he added.\n\nJones didn\u2019t address the outlook for Australia\u2019s economy or monetary policy during his session.\n\nJones said that the central bank is also looking at the foreign exchange exposures of Australian pension funds, given their growing investment in offshore assets.\n\n\u201cOne is the potential for very large moves in foreign exchange markets to accompany these other market stress events and accelerate or perpetuate the call on liquidity in a stress event,\u201d Jones said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s also the other element of just outside of stress events, the fact that this community here will become almost certainly a larger and larger player in the FX swap market.\u201d\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIndy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans What America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations The CDC Won\u2019t Give the Public a Full Picture of Fertility Treatment Risks\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments",

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Goldman Sachs\u2019 35 AI Superstars.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nIn September 2024, Peter Oppenheimer, the chief of global equity strategy and the head of macro research for Goldman Sachs in Europe, opined that the rise of tech stocks due to the AI boom was not indicative of a financial bubble. Instead, per the Goldman bigwig, the performance of these companies was expected to continue delivering solid returns to investors, fueled by the rise of AI superstars outside of the magnificent seven, among smaller tech firms and in non-tech sectors. In the months since, the AI hype has only grown stronger, leading to a massive surge in the value of tech offerings, only offset by the recent emergence of Chinese AI startup DeepSeek which is positioning itself as a budget ChatGPT. The success of this Chinese startup, popularized by the downloads that the DeepSeek application has achieved on the mobile operating system markets, has led to a downward spiral in American tech futures.\n\nAlthough the tech sector selloff has caught many investors by surprise, a new investor note by Goldman Sachs, as seen by news agency Reuters, contends that hedge funds were already anticipating this slump. Per the Goldman report, in the last two weeks, hedge funds have significantly reduced their positions in technology stocks. This retreat is part of a broader trend, as hedge funds have remained hesitant to reinvest in tech-related sectors following the sell-off from June to August last year. Alongside selling major technology stocks, hedge funds have also been offloading shares in adjacent industries, such as power and energy companies that would benefit from AI advancements\u2014especially those supporting data centers and electric vehicle infrastructure.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nHowever, Goldman remains bullish on AI futures. Per Oppenheimer, tech stocks have dominated global and US equity returns since 2010, contributing 32% and 40%, respectively. The Goldman executive further claims that unlike speculative bubbles, these gains are backed by strong financials, with tech sector earnings per share surging 400% since the 2008 financial crisis, compared to a modest 25% increase across other sectors. Hyperscale companies in software and cloud computing have been key drivers of this growth, leveraging their vast resources and high profitability, he notes. Recent AI advancements have further boosted their valuations, concentrating gains among a few market leaders. Oppenheimer highlights that this pattern is consistent with past technological innovations, where capital inflows and competition drive rapid growth before eventual consolidation.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhile dominant AI companies today were also leaders in the previous tech wave, new competitors are emerging, he predicts. The report further notes that the number of AI patents jumped from 8,000 in 2018 to over 60,000 in 2022, signaling growing competition. History suggests that the companies pioneering a technology may not be the ones to benefit most in the long run, Oppenheimer claims. Just as internet infrastructure investments paved the way for social media and ride-sharing dominance, the greatest value in AI may emerge from new players that leverage current advancements in unexpected ways, per the Goldman strategist. The Oppenheimer point of view is echoed in the latest Goldman report. This report highlights that over the past year, hedge funds have been more inclined to sell rather than buy stocks that would typically gain value from a US-driven AI boom.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nHowever, a smaller group of hedge funds has maintained long positions, meaning they are betting that stock values will rise. In fact, these hedge funds currently hold the highest number of long positions in two years, indicating some confidence in future AI-driven growth, the report adds. Goldman underlines that the investment climate in AI has been heavily influenced by substantial spending from major US technology firms. Following the success of ChatGPT, companies have invested tens of billions of dollars in AI infrastructure. Notably, OpenAI and SoftBank recently committed $19 billion to fund Stargate, a joint venture aimed at developing AI data centers in the United States. Despite these large-scale investments, competition from international players such as Chinese AI startup DeepSeek has raised concerns about the long-term sustainability of US leadership in the AI sector.\n\nBruno Schneller, managing director at Erlen Capital Management, noted that hedge funds are adopting a cautious wait-and-see approach toward US AI-related stocks. Schneller further highlighted that large projects like Stargate come with significant regulatory complexities. The ongoing uncertainty regarding regulatory execution and enforcement has left many investors wary, contributing to the market\u2019s volatility. While the US AI sector continues to receive significant investments, hedge funds remain uncertain about its profitability in the face of growing international competition and regulatory uncertainties. This cautious stance has led to stock market fluctuations, with many hedge funds opting to sell their tech-related holdings while a select few continue to maintain long positions, betting on future growth.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through a note on the AI industry by investment bank Goldman Sachs. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Dan Niles: Apple (AAPL) Bulls \u2018Trying to Pretend\u2019 an Upgrade Cycle is Coming\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. In the fourth quarter of 2024, Apple reported a revenue of $94.9 billion, marking a 6% increase from the same period in the previous year. This growth was attributed to the successful launch of new products, including the iPhone 16 lineup, Apple Watch Series 10, and AirPods 4. Apple has been integrating AI across its product ecosystem to enhance user experience and drive growth. In June 2024, the company introduced Apple Intelligence, a personal intelligence system for iPhone, iPad, and Mac. This system combines generative models with personal context to deliver relevant and useful intelligence to users. By October 2024, Apple Intelligence became available to users, offering features such as writing refinement, notification summaries, and a more natural and capable Siri. These AI-driven enhancements have been well-received, contributing to increased user engagement and satisfaction.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 6th on our list of Goldman Sachs' AI superstars. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

Hedge funds have been reducing their positions in tech stocks, including Apple, indicating some skepticism. The emergence of Chinese AI startup DeepSeek and concerns about US leadership in the AI sector add to the uncertainty. Regulatory complexities surrounding AI projects also contribute to market volatility. The article suggests that while Apple is an AI superstar, other stocks might offer higher returns in a shorter timeframe. Considering these factors, the positive and negative influences seem relatively balanced.

Generally, if the earnings report exceeds market expectations, it can lead to a rise in stock price, while disappointing results can lead to a decline. Given the context of the broader economic indicators, such as the anticipated slowdown in GDP growth and the pending home sales data, there may be a cautious sentiment in the market. However, Apple's strong brand and historical performance may mitigate some negative impacts.

The market's reaction will depend on whether the earnings meet, exceed, or fall short of expectations. Secondly, the release of Q4 GDP data, expected to show slowing growth, could negatively impact market sentiment generally, and potentially Apple's stock. However, the impact on Apple might be less direct than the earnings report. Finally, home sales data is less directly relevant to Apple's performance. Considering these factors, the earnings report is the most significant driver. Without knowing the earnings expectations, it's difficult to give a precise probability. I'm assuming a slightly positive outlook, as Apple is a strong company, but the slowing GDP growth introduces some uncertainty."

The article itself provides no specific information about Apple's expected performance, only that earnings will be released.  Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock price is uncertain.  The probability of a price rise or fall is heavily dependent on the actual earnings report and how it's received by the market.  Given the lack of directional information in the news, a neutral probability is assigned, slightly favoring a neutral outcome due to the overall market uncertainty implied by the inclusion of GDP and housing data."

Given Apple's strong market position and historical performance, there is optimism about its earnings, but the uncertainty of the actual results and the broader economic context (slowing GDP growth) introduces some risk. Therefore, while there is a reasonable chance of a positive reaction to earnings, there is also a non-negligible chance of a negative reaction if earnings disappoint or if broader economic concerns weigh on investor sentiment."

The news doesn't present any specific negative news about Apple's performance or prospects, but rather focuses on the broader trend of reduced returns for Big Tech due to their collective behavior.  Therefore, the probability of a price rise is slightly lower than a price fall, reflecting the overall negative sentiment towards the group's future returns, although the impact on Apple specifically is likely to be muted compared to companies more directly impacted by AI competition."

The metaphor suggests that these companies are viewed as safe assets, leading to lower expected returns due to excessive spending and competition among themselves. The mention of a tech sell-off triggered by news from DeepSeek, a Chinese AI start-up, adds to the negative sentiment. Given this context, the news leans bearish for AAPL, as it implies potential overvaluation and reduced future returns. However, Apple's strong fundamentals and investor trust in Big Tech could mitigate some downside risk."

This phenomenon may result in 'pretty low returns' for these companies.

                "reasoning": "The news article discusses the 'Magnificent Seven' tech companies, including Apple, and how they are viewed as safe assets by investors. However, according to Harvard Law professor Mihir Desai, this perception leads to low expected returns due to the companies spending money on each other, creating a self-sustaining cycle. This phenomenon is likened to a 'snake eating its own tail.' Given this analysis, the news does not seem to provide a strong positive catalyst for Apple's stock price. Instead, it highlights a potential issue with the tech sector's concentration and the low returns that may result from it. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling."

He also points out that these companies are spending excessively on each other, which he likens to a 'snake eating its own tail,' implying unsustainable practices. This could lead to lower returns and potentially impact investor sentiment negatively."

Therefore, without direct relevance, the impact on Apple's stock price should be minimal. However, in the tech industry, positive news about one major player can sometimes influence investor sentiment towards others, potentially leading to a slight, indirect positive effect.

        "content": "We recently published a list of 11 Best Consumer Electronics Stocks to Invest in Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)) stands against other best consumer electronics stocks to invest in now.\n\nThe global consumer electronics market has seen significant growth, reaching a valuation of $755 billion in 2024, with projections to hit $1.15 trillion by 2031, according to Research and Markets. This growth is driven by rising demand for innovative devices that enhance convenience. Consumer electronics, including smartphones, tablets, smartwatches, and connected home devices, have transformed how people live, work, and connect.\n\nContinuous innovation also keeps the industry competitive, with companies focused on attracting consumer interest. Despite global economic challenges, the market remains resilient, driven by advancements in AI. In 2023, smartphone shipments reached about 1.2 billion units, reinforcing this category\u2019s profitability. The market is projected to grow to $1.13 trillion by 2025, with a 3% annual growth rate. North America, particularly the US, is at the forefront of the consumer electronics market, leading globally in terms of adoption and demand. The region is expected to maintain this leadership due to its swift embrace of cutting-edge technologies. In the US, the fast-paced lifestyle increasingly revolves around digital solutions, with automation becoming a key priority.\n\nTim Seymour, Seymour Asset Management CIO, appeared on CNBC\u2019s \u2018The Exchange\u2019 on January 18 to signify upcoming events and how they might correlate with current market dynamics. Seymour notes that the tech sector, which includes consumer electronics, has rallied under President Trump, creating a favorable hiring environment. He believes that at least half of the MAG7 stocks have defensible valuations. Regarding tariffs, he suggests that consumer-centered sectors, like consumer electronics, will be impacted first, with reports indicating that tariffs could negatively affect the economy, as highlighted by the World Bank and IMF.\n\nDiscussing the economic implications of tariffs, Seymour expressed skepticism about tax increases while acknowledging uncertainty around reductions. He reflected on the tariffs imposed against China in 2018 and 2019, which impacted manufacturing, including consumer electronics. While tariffs may hinder growth, he noted that a strong dollar could enhance the competitiveness of US products abroad. Seymour focused on tech companies with solid valuations for their growth potential. Large MNCs in consumer electronics may perform better with upcoming announcements and are less vulnerable to strategic influences than smaller firms. While he is cautious about growth scares overshadowing inflationary pressures in 2025, he maintains a positive sentiment overall.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMethodology\n\nWe first sifted through ETFs, online rankings, and internet lists to compile a list of the top consumer electronics stocks. We then selected the 11 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q3 2024. The hedge fund data was sourced from Insider Monkey\u2019s database which tracks the moves of over 900 elite money managers.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) the Best Consumer Electronics Stock to Invest in Now?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a tech giant known for its innovative consumer electronics products. Its popular products include iPhones, Mac computers, iPad tablets, and wearables like Apple Watches and AirPods. It also provides an ecosystem of services like app stores, streaming services, and cloud solutions, which enhance the user experience across its entire product line.\n\nRecent years have witnessed a slowdown in iPhone sales growth. But the company\u2019s investments in AI, showcased by the recent introduction of Apple Intelligence, will reignite growth. Apple Intelligence, which is a suite of AI-powered tools and services integrated into the iPhone, assists users with tasks like email composition, notification summarization, and appointment scheduling.\n\nFollowing its launch of Apple Intelligence, Rosenblatt Securities maintained a Buy rating for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) with a $262 target price on January 27. This was despite concerns about disappointing iPhone performance in the December quarter, echoed by UBS. While Apple Intelligence and upcoming software updates hold promise for future growth, intense competition from Chinese brands like Huawei, which offer advanced AI and aggressive pricing, poses a significant challenge. The company experienced a 7.7% sales drop in China in FY24. This decline came from competition from domestic brands and a sluggish Chinese economy. To mitigate this, it\u2019s shifting its focus from hardware sales towards revenue streams like its App Store services.\n\nMar Vista Strategic Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock was strong in the quarter as investors viewed the company\u2019s generative AI roadmap and iPhone 16 product cycle positively. The market was reminded of the strength of the Apple ecosystem as management demonstrated how generative AI solutions would be integrated into its iOS 18 operating system, which was broadly released in the iPhone 16 late in calendar Q3. We believe Apple\u2019s generative AI-enabled products should spur a meaningful iPhone upgrade cycle and create new avenues of monetization through its app store and advertising offerings. We believe this will support intrinsic value growth that will range between high single digits and low double-digits over our investment horizon.\u201d\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 1st on our list of best consumer electronics stocks to invest in now. As we acknowledge the growth potential of AAPL, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

However, there are also concerns. iPhone sales growth has slowed, and competition from Chinese brands like Huawei is intensifying, particularly in the Chinese market where Apple experienced a sales drop. Tim Seymour's comments about potential negative impacts from tariffs on consumer electronics add another layer of uncertainty. The article also highlights the shift towards services revenue, indicating a potential change in Apple's core business strategy. Considering these factors, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall, but not overwhelmingly so, reflecting the mixed signals in the news."

Counterbalancing these negative factors are Apple's investments in AI (Apple Intelligence), positive analyst ratings (Rosenblatt Securities' Buy rating with a $262 target price), and the belief that AI integration will spur iPhone upgrades and create new monetization avenues.  The mention of tariffs and economic uncertainty adds further complexity.  Given the mixed signals, a neutral to slightly positive outlook is warranted, leaning towards a higher probability of a price rise due to the positive AI developments and overall market growth, but acknowledging the risks."

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer's Game Plan: Top 14 Stocks to Watch.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks.\n\nJim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, recently shared his thoughts on the upcoming earnings season, emphasizing that investors should tread carefully and avoid making any big moves.\n\n\u201cWhen people think about an exciting time for stocks, they think of the next two weeks, that's when some of the most important consequential companies on Earth report, practically at the same time. Throw in the actions of the new president and all I can say is, we're not gonna have any idea what the heck we're doing until we have time, probably at night to sift through all the data points and study all the conference calls.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: Jim Cramer Looked At These 7 Stocks Recently and Jim Cramer Recently Shed Light on These 9 Stocks\n\nCramer stressed that the current week, in particular, is too difficult for snap judgments. He warned that the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision on Wednesday will only add to the uncertainty. At one point, it seemed like the market could expect a rate cut, which would push stocks higher, but then Amex reported that its customers were spending at a rapid pace. He said:\n\n\u201cBut when American Express says today that its millions of customers are spending like mad, the Fed can't possibly give us a rate cut, can it?\u201d\n\nHe added that if the Fed does lower rates on Wednesday, it would likely be because Chairman Jerome Powell has caved to President Trump\u2019s demand for immediate cuts. In this complex situation, Cramer advised investors to just sit tight and not act, pointing out that it would be a \u201cno-win situation\u201d for Powell.\n\nAs if the pressure of earnings reports and the Fed's decision were not enough, Cramer also noted that this week would feature the release of the Fed\u2019s favored inflation measure, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index. However, Cramer does not expect good news, given the high level of consumer spending.\n\n\u201cThe exhausting bottom line: Look it\u2019s a sheer hell week. Our heads will be spinning, swivel-like, lazy Susan even, as each day you can expect a flood of earnings and a sound bite from President Trump that upsets whatever order there might be. Like I always say, don\u2019t try to make decisions during this part of earnings season, just listen. It's too hard and I don't want you to lose money just because this is one of eight super exciting weeks of the year.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 14 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on January 24. We listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them. We also provided hedge fund sentiment for each stock as of the third quarter of 2024, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) The Best American Stock To Buy and Hold in 2025?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nDuring the episode, Cramer talked about Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and here\u2019s what he had to say:\n\n\u201cAfter the close, we have the most widely anticipated disappointment that I've ever seen. I'm about to be facetious. I want you to hear this. It's facetious but here's what we're gonna hear. Let's see. We have horrendous Chinese cell phone orders, no lift from new AI, a surprising slowdown in service revenues, lackluster Vision Pro sales, and of course, a radical chop to the forecast for the rest of the year, all way below the consensus. There, that's everything I've heard about Apple for the last two weeks.\n\nCramer advised against trading the stock, urging investors to hold onto it instead. He noted that Apple is an exceptional company with outstanding management and that any issues the company faces will eventually be addressed, even if the timing remains uncertain. Cramer emphasized that historically, it has been more beneficial to simply hold Apple stock rather than trying to trade it.\n\nHe also pointed out that his Charitable Trust has seen a remarkable performance with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) precisely because the company has control over its own future, which he said is easier to maintain when management is excellent and products are of the highest quality.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 11th on our list of stocks to watch according to Jim Cramer. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

The article also highlights that Cramer's focus is shifting towards AI stocks, implying a relative lack of confidence in Apple's immediate future compared to other sectors.  However, the fact that he still recommends holding the stock long-term suggests the negative impact might be temporary and not catastrophic.  Therefore, the probability of a price fall is assigned a higher value than a price rise, but not an extreme value, reflecting the uncertainty inherent in market reactions and Cramer's own mixed message."

        "headline": "DeepSeek sends 2 big signals that shatter tech investor assumptions: Snowflake CEO",
        "content": "Listen and subscribe to Opening Bid on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube, or wherever you find your favorite podcasts.\n\nDeepSeek has caused a permanent reset in how AI development will unfold in coming years.\n\nAt least that's the take from Snowflake (SNOW) CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy, whose data storage company provides technology used by companies developing large language models like DeepSeek and ChatGPT.\n\n\"So what this [news] basically does is two things. One, it says there's still a lot of innovation left and many companies can aspire to train these models. But, two, it also raises the really interesting question of do you need to spend billions of dollars in order to train cutting-edge, world-class models? I think the jury is still out there for things like that, but it's basically upended our assumptions about where AI is going,\" Ramaswamy told me on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen in below).\n\nDeepSeek is a Chinese company that has burst onto the tech landscape seemingly out of nowhere.\n\nLast week, it surprised more than just markets after unveiling RI, its AI model that gave a ChatGPT-esque performance at an arguably cheaper price tag. RI costs a reported $5.6 million to build a base model, compared to the hundreds of millions of dollars incurred at US-based companies such as OpenAI and Anthropic.\n\nWatch: Why billionaire investor Ray Dalio is concerned about tech valuations\n\nFears mounted instantly that US companies are overspending on AI infrastructure, which includes Nvidia (NVDA) chips.\n\nIn response, stocks went haywire on Monday. Nvidia\u2019s market value dropped by $588.8 billion, or 16.97%. It was the biggest ever single-day loss in a stock\u2019s market cap in absolute terms, according to Deutsche Bank data. Monday's decline for Nvidia was larger than the total market cap of Exxon or Mastercard.\n\nThe sell-off in Nvidia has persisted into Wednesday, with shares down 4.5%. The AI darling has seen its stock tank 11% so far this year.\n\n\"DeepSeek model suggests the cost of training GenAI models is set to decline substantially \u2026 which we see leading to faster gen-AI product innovation and availability,\" Morgan Stanley tech analyst Brian Nowak said in a note.\n\nSee more from the Opening Bid podcast\n\nDeepSeek just revealed a huge risk to the stock market Billionaire Ray Dalio offers fresh tips on how to be a better investor Another bitcoin bubble will happen: Nouriel 'Dr. Doom' Roubini\n\nNowak stayed upbeat on Microsoft (MSFT) despite its investment exposure to OpenAI.\n\nInterestingly, Nowak thinks Apple's stock could be a winner as fears about DeepSeek's impact weigh on the Magnificent Seven names.\n\n\"Apple's AI ambitions are far more contained than the majority of the Mag 7 (or other frontier model developers), as Apple is currently focused on smaller, function-specific, on-device LLM's, rather than large frontier models. As a result, Apple's annual capex ($9.4B in FY24) is about 1/20th the scale of the US Tier 1 hyperscalers combined, and therefore if the market hyper-focuses on capex ROI, the threshold for Apple to deliver an attractive return is far lower (i.e. less risk) than the T1 hyperscalers,\" explained Nowak.\n\nStory Continues\n\nSnowflake's Ramaswamy thinks investors need to be on high alert for more developments out of DeepSeek rivals in China.\n\n\"Even the fact that they were able to do this coming out of nowhere is a wake-up call again, that there's lots of innovation to go and many people should be trying it,\" said Ramaswamy.\n\nThree times each week, I field insight-filled conversations and chats with the biggest names in business and markets on Opening Bid.

                "reasoning": "The news highlights a significant shift in the AI landscape due to DeepSeek's cost-effective AI model, which raises concerns about the spending habits of major US tech companies, including Apple. However, analysts suggest that Apple's focus on smaller, function-specific AI models may shield it from the negative impacts seen by larger competitors like Nvidia. This positions Apple favorably in a market that may be overly concerned about capital expenditures and returns on investment. Therefore, while there is some risk due to the overall market sentiment, the specific context of Apple's strategy suggests a higher probability of stock price stability or rise compared to a fall."

                "reasoning": "The news suggests a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). On one hand, the emergence of DeepSeek and the potential for cheaper AI model development could negatively impact companies heavily invested in large-scale AI infrastructure, potentially benefiting Apple due to its focus on smaller, on-device AI models and lower capital expenditure. Morgan Stanley's analyst Brian Nowak specifically mentioned Apple as a potential winner. However, the overall market sentiment regarding AI investments is currently volatile, as evidenced by the significant drop in Nvidia's market value. This general uncertainty could also negatively impact Apple's stock, even if indirectly. Considering these factors, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a stock price rise due to the positive analyst sentiment and Apple's comparatively lower risk profile in the AI space, but the overall market volatility keeps the probability of a fall significant."

Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak, however, believes Apple (AAPL) could benefit from this shift.  His reasoning is that Apple's AI strategy is focused on smaller, on-device models, requiring significantly less capital expenditure compared to large language model developers. This makes Apple less vulnerable to the concerns raised by DeepSeek's success.  Therefore, the news presents a positive outlook for Apple, contrasting with the negative impact on companies heavily invested in large-scale AI development. While the overall market reaction to DeepSeek is negative for some tech giants, Apple's different approach positions it as a potential winner in this scenario."

This has led to significant market reactions, including a sharp decline in Nvidia's stock due to fears of overspending on AI infrastructure. However, the analysis suggests that Apple (AAPL) might benefit from this development because its AI ambitions are more contained and focused on smaller, function-specific models, reducing its risk compared to other tech giants. The market might view Apple as a safer bet in this new landscape, potentially leading to increased investor confidence and a rise in its stock price."

        "content": "Apple (AAPL, Financials) was downgraded to Perform from Outperform by Oppenheimer ahead of its first-quarter fiscal 2025 earnings report, with analysts citing slowing iPhone sales and competitive pressures in China.\n\nPointing to a reduced iPhone sales forecast over the next 12 to 18 months, the investment group also eliminated its $250 price estimate on the shares. Two main issues raised by Oppenheimer analysts Martin Young and Andrew Northcutt were growing competition in China and a dearth of convincing Apple Intelligence and generative artificial intelligence apps to propel near term device upgrades.\n\nReferring to Canalys statistics, the company observed that Apple exports to China dropped 25% in the fourth quarter and dropped 17% in the fourth quarter. Young noted that a delayed iPhone replacement cycle into fiscal 2026 might arise from Apple Intelligence's sluggish adoption and the lack of major generative AI consumer apps.\n\nFrom prior predictions of $431 billion and $7.73, Oppenheimer reduced its fiscal 2025 sales and earnings per share estimates to $407 billion and $7.22, respectively.\n\nAfter the market closes on Thursday, Apple is scheduled to unveil its first-quarter fiscal 2025 earnings.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

While the market may have already partially priced in some negative sentiment, the downgrade from a reputable firm adds weight to the bearish outlook.  The upcoming earnings report will be crucial, but the pre-announcement news suggests a higher probability of disappointing results, further pressuring the stock price.  The removal of the $250 price target also indicates a significant downward revision of the analyst's valuation.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other safe stocks.\n\nHedge funds, known for their sophisticated investment strategies and ability to generate returns across market cycles, have a complex performance history. Since their inception in 1949, hedge funds have evolved significantly, with returns varying widely by strategy, market conditions, and the broader economic environment. The first hedge fund was created by Alfred Winslow Jones in 1949, combining long and short equity positions to hedge against market risk. During the 1950s and 1960s, hedge funds gained attention for their ability to outperform traditional mutual funds. Jones\u2019s fund reportedly generated returns of approximately 20% annually in its early years, setting a precedent for the industry.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nThe 1970s and early 1980s were challenging due to high inflation, stagflation, and the oil crisis, but some hedge funds excelled by capitalizing on macroeconomic trends. Macro-focused funds like those led by George Soros delivered impressive returns by making bold bets on currencies and commodities. For example, Soros famously earned $1 billion in 1992 by shorting the British pound. The 1990s were a golden era for hedge funds, marked by rapid industry growth and strong performance. The average annual return of hedge funds during this period was approximately 15%, according to data from Hedge Fund Research. Managers benefited from a booming stock market, globalization, and the rise of new asset classes.\n\nNotable successes included Tiger Management, led by Julian Robertson, and Renaissance Technologies, whose Medallion Fund achieved annualized returns exceeding 30%. The 2000s were a mixed decade for hedge funds. The early 2000s saw strong performance during the dot-com crash, as many funds profited from short positions in overvalued tech stocks. Between 2000 and 2002, the S&P 500 fell by 43%, while hedge funds, on average, delivered positive annualized returns of around 6%. However, the 2008 financial crisis tested the industry. The HFRI Fund Weighted Composite Index declined by 19% in 2008, its worst annual performance on record. However, since the 2010s, there has been a prolonged bull market, barring minor blips during the pandemic, during which hedge funds have shined relative to other investment vehicles.\n\nStory Continues\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nFor this article, we selected stocks that have solid businesses with recurring revenue streams, reliable dividend payouts, and burgeoning growth pipelines.

It will be the first Apple device with an Apple 5G modem. Additionally, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is working on an 11th-generation iPad with a faster chip and support for Wi-Fi 6E. The tablet is also expected to feature Apple's custom-designed modem chip, an A17 Pro chip, and 8GB RAM. Lastly, the iPad Air is going to get updated with either an M3 or M4 chip, and it could debut alongside a new lower-cost Magic Keyboard that Apple is developing for the more affordable iPad models.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of the safest stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

The article emphasizes Apple's consistent dividend growth, upcoming product launches, and its ranking as one of the safest stocks according to hedge funds. These factors suggest a favorable outlook for AAPL, leading to a higher probability of stock price increase. However, the mention of other stocks potentially offering higher returns may temper some enthusiasm. Overall, the positive sentiment from hedge funds and the company's solid fundamentals support a higher probability of price rise compared to a fall."

                "reasoning": "The news article highlights that Apple is a popular stock among hedge funds, which are often seen as sophisticated investors. This suggests a positive sentiment towards the stock. The article also mentions Apple's consistent dividend growth and upcoming product releases, which could attract more investors. However, the article also states that there are potentially better investment opportunities with higher returns, which could temper enthusiasm for Apple.

While this suggests a positive sentiment, the article also tempers expectations by stating that other stocks offer potentially higher returns in a shorter timeframe.  The mention of new product launches (iPhone, iPad, MacBook Air) is positive, but this is already generally anticipated by the market and likely priced in. The article's focus on hedge fund holdings is not a strong indicator of imminent price movement, as hedge fund strategies are diverse and long-term. Therefore, the news is mildly positive but not overwhelmingly bullish.  The probability of a price rise is slightly higher than the probability of a fall, reflecting the generally positive sentiment but acknowledging the article's cautious tone and the inherent uncertainty of the stock market."

Additionally, the article mentions that hedge funds are bullish on AAPL, which often signals confidence in the stock's performance. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than it falling. However, the article also notes that there might be other stocks with higher potential returns, which could slightly temper the bullish sentiment."

Given that Apple is part of the Big Tech group and will be influenced by the overall market sentiment and the outcomes of other tech companies' earnings, there is a moderate probability of a stock price rise.

While the article doesn't directly mention Apple's earnings, it highlights that CEO commentary on capex commitment and the perceived importance of high-end Nvidia chips for AI development will be crucial. A strong commitment to AI capex could be viewed positively by investors, suggesting future growth and innovation. However, uncertainty surrounding DeepSeek's AI model and its efficiency introduces a note of caution. Since the article doesn't provide specific information about Apple's AI strategy or capex plans, the impact on Apple's stock price is uncertain. Given the general positive sentiment towards large-cap growth and the potential for positive CEO commentary, there's a slightly higher probability of a stock price rise.

While Apple is mentioned in the headline as part of Big Tech, the article's content doesn't directly address Apple's AI investments or earnings.  The emphasis is on other companies' upcoming earnings calls and their CEOs' commentary regarding AI CapEx.  Therefore, the impact of this news on Apple's stock price is likely to be indirect and minimal.  The overall market sentiment (influenced by Fed decisions and other Big Tech earnings) will likely have a much stronger influence on AAPL than this specific news piece.

Shares were down a fraction in morning trading.\n\nThe investment firm also removed its $250 price target, reducing its full-year revenue and EPS forecasts to $407 billion and $7.22, down from $431 billion and $7.73.

Analysts expect the iPhone replacement cycle to slow into FY 2026, given the gradual rollout of AppleIntelligence features and stronger AI competition.\n\nApple is set to report Q1 earnings post-market on Thursday, with Wall Street expecting adjusted EPS of $2.35 on $124.04 billion in revenue.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

The cited 25% drop in Q4 iPhone shipments to China is significant.  While the upcoming earnings report could offer a counter-narrative, the pre-earnings downgrade and the analysts' concerns about competition and a slowing replacement cycle suggest a higher probability of a price fall.  The expectation of weaker-than-previously-forecast revenue and EPS further supports this. However, Apple is a large, established company, and the market may have already partially priced in some negative news.

However, the news also acknowledges DeepSeek as a substantial engineering feat, which could be interpreted as a positive for the overall AI market and potentially spurring further innovation. The overall impact is likely slightly negative due to the competitive and geopolitical concerns, but not drastically so, as Apple has a diversified business and strong brand loyalty."

However, the connection between DeepSeek's advancement and Apple's stock price is tenuous. The news doesn't directly impact Apple's products, financials, or operations.  Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal. The probability of a price change in either direction is low, with the most likely scenario being no significant movement."

While the emergence of a cost-effective AI competitor could pressure Apple's AI investments and market position, the broader geopolitical implications (e.g., data security, trade tensions) may also weigh on investor sentiment. However, Apple's diversified business model and strong brand may mitigate some of the negative impact. The overall effect is likely neutral to slightly negative in the short term."

Given the indirect nature of the news and the balanced perspective provided, the probability of a significant stock price movement is uncertain.

The reasons cited are competition in China and a perceived lack of compelling AI features. These are significant concerns for a company like Apple. A downgrade from 'Outperform' to 'Perform' suggests the analyst no longer expects the stock to outperform the market. This, coupled with the timing just before earnings, increases the likelihood of a negative reaction from investors. However, the earnings report itself could be a counteracting force. If Apple's earnings are strong and their guidance is positive, it could offset the negative impact of the downgrade. Given the uncertainty surrounding the earnings report, I'm assigning a higher probability to a stock price fall, but not overwhelmingly so, as a positive earnings surprise could change the narrative."

The cited reasons \u2013 increased competition in China and a lack of compelling AI features \u2013 are significant concerns for investors.  While Apple's earnings report could potentially offset this negative sentiment, the downgrade itself suggests a less optimistic outlook from a reputable analyst firm.  The probability of a price fall is therefore higher than a price rise in the short term, immediately following the news. However, it's important to note that Apple is a large, established company, and the market's reaction might be muted or even positive if the earnings report surpasses expectations.  The probabilities are estimates and subject to change based on the upcoming earnings report and overall market conditions."

This would follow the 32.9% earnings growth on 15.4% higher revenues in the third quarter. Per Bloomberg Intelligence, profits of the Mag 7 are projected to increase by 22% in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, the smallest jump since the first quarter of 2023.\r\n\r\nSee the Zacks Earnings Calendar to stay ahead of market-making news.\r\n\r\nTesla\r\n\r\nTesla has an Earnings ESP of +1.68% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). According to our methodology, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 increases the chances of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they\u2019re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\r\n\r\nThe electric carmaker saw a negative earnings estimate revision of a penny over the past seven days for the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings indicates substantial year-over-year growth of 4.2% and revenue growth of 9.3%. The earnings track record of the company is moderate as it delivered a four-quarter average earnings surprise of 0.13%.

Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nTesla, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Tesla, Inc. Quote\n\nTesla has made a solid comeback, especially after Trump's election victory, and reclaimed its trillion-dollar market cap. The EV maker is expected to benefit from Musk's proximity to Trump's administration during its second term. Trump's administration could help expedite regulatory approval for new versions of Tesla's self-driving software and for its autonomous \"robotaxis\" to hit the road.\r\n\r\nHowever, Tesla stock took a hit when the company missed estimates for fourth-quarter deliveries and recorded its first year-over-year decline in full-year vehicle deliveries in the company's history. Trump recently rolled back pro-EV policies, which also weighed on TSLA shares. Tesla shares fell 5% in a month. \r\n\r\nMicrosoft\r\n\r\nMicrosoft has an Earnings ESP of -2.13% and a Zacks Rank #3. This software maker has witnessed a negative earnings estimate revision of a penny over the past seven days for the second quarter of fiscal 2025. Microsoft\u2019s earnings surprise history is good, as it delivered an earnings surprise of 4.91%, on average, in the last four quarters.

It has been investing billions of dollars in expanding its global network of data centers and other physical infrastructure required to develop AI technology that can compose documents, make images and serve as a lifelike personal assistant at work or home.\n\nIn the latest development, Microsoft plans to spend $80 billion in fiscal 2025 on constructing data centers designed for artificial intelligence workloads. Over half of this spending will be focused on the United States, according to a blog post by Brad Smith, Microsoft vice chair and president.\r\n\r\nThough Azure growth will continue to slow down, Microsoft expects its AI business to be on track to bring in more than $10 billion in sales sometime in the coming quarters. Microsoft expects revenues of $68.1-$69.1 billion for the fiscal second quarter of 2025, implying 10.6% growth at the mid-point.\r\n\r\nMeta Platforms\r\n\r\nMeta Platforms has an Earnings ESP of +6.74% and Zacks Rank #3. The social media giant saw a solid earnings estimate revision of 15 cents for the fourth quarter over the past seven days. Analysts increasing estimates right before earnings \u2014 with the most up-to-date information possible \u2014 is a good indicator for the stock. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the yet-to-be-reported quarter indicates substantial year-over-year earnings growth of 29.5%. Revenues are expected to increase 17.1% year over year. Meta Platforms delivered an earnings surprise of 11.34%, on average, in the last four quarters. Shares of META have gained about 14% over the past three months.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc.

Wedbush raised the price target for the stock from $680 to $700 and BofA Global Securities lifted the price target to $710 from $660.\r\n\r\nThe world\u2019s largest social media platform expects to post revenues in the range of $45-$48 billion for the fourth quarter. However, Meta expects a \u201csignificant acceleration\u201d in infrastructure spending this year as it continues to pour money into developing AI. Chief executive Mark Zuckerberg pledged to spend significantly on infrastructure and other projects like the metaverse and AI-powered glasses. Meta plans to invest around $60 to $65 billion in AI in 2025, up from $40 billion spent in 2024. Management also plans to launch its own GPUs by the end of the year. \r\n\r\nApple\r\n\r\nApple has an Earnings ESP of -1.51% and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Apple saw no earnings estimate revision over the past 30 days for the fiscal first quarter of 2025. The iPhone maker has a strong track record of positive earnings surprises. It delivered an average earnings surprise of 5.05% in the trailing four quarters. The Zacks Consensus Estimate indicates a modest year-over-year increase of 8.3% for earnings and 3.7% for revenues.

Since both AI applications are only for English-language users, these features haven\u2019t boosted sales of iPhone 16 handsets.\u00a0 As such, Jefferies downgraded Apple to underperform, which was rare. Apple expects to add AI features in other languages starting in April.\r\n\r\nOn the last earnings call, Apple offered weak sales guidance for the fiscal first quarter.

While the overall outlook for the group is positive, with projected earnings growth, Apple's specific situation presents a more nuanced picture.  Apple's Earnings ESP is negative (-1.51%), and its Zacks Rank is #4 (Sell), suggesting a higher probability of missing earnings expectations.  Furthermore, the article mentions weak sales guidance and the limited impact of its initial AI applications.  While Apple has a strong history of positive earnings surprises, the current indicators point towards a more cautious outlook.  The recent Jefferies downgrade to underperform further reinforces this concern.  Therefore, the probability of a price fall is considered higher than a price rise, although the overall market sentiment towards tech and the potential for a positive surprise cannot be entirely discounted."

        "content": "Reddit (RDDT) is climbing 2% this morning after rallying nearly 8% yesterday. In a note to investors yesterday afternoon, investment bank Piper Sandler contended that a technical update by the social media firm may enable it to attract more advertisers.\n\nReddit's Update Could Be Significant\n\nThe company has made it easier for marketers to replicate on Reddit the ad campaigns that they're using on Meta (META), Piper Sandler analyst Thomas Champion explained. As a result, the number of firms advertising on Reddit could meaningfully increase, Champion asserted. Such a development, in turn, could cause the firm's revenue growth to accelerate, the analyst wrote.Evercore ISI Maintains \"Outperform\" Rating on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Sees AI Benefits Driving Future Growth\n\nA close up of a user's hand scrolling through a mobile social media application.\n\nAnother Investment Bank Was Recently Bearish on RDDT\n\nIn a note to investors on Jan. 22, investment bank Roth Capital downgraded the stock to Neutral from Buy. The investment bank predicted that the company's revenue growth would decelerate in upcoming quarters, and it expects RDDT's EBITA margins to drop over the next year.\n\nAdditionally, Roth predicts that the company's user growth will slow this year after it added a record number of users in 2024. It placed a $195 price target on RDDT.\n\nThe Recent Price Action of RDDT\n\nIn the last month, the shares have advanced 20%, while they are up 70% in the last three months.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of RDDT, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than RDDT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD ALSO 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock\n\nDisclosure: None.

The contrasting bearish outlook from Roth Capital on RDDT may also indirectly benefit AAPL as investors might seek more stable investments.

The mention of AI benefits for Apple is a positive factor, but it's presented as a secondary point. Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be neutral to slightly positive. Given the limited direct impact, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a rise than a fall, but not significantly so."

The article mentions Evercore ISI maintaining an \"Outperform\" rating on Apple due to AI benefits, but this is separate from the RDDT discussion and doesn't provide a strong basis for predicting AAPL's price movement based solely on this news.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other best American stocks to buy and hold in 2025.\n\nWill the Market Continue To Be Bullish in 2025?\n\nWall Street\u2019s outlook for the stock market in 2025 reflects a cautious optimism following two consecutive years of substantial gains. Analysts predict continued growth, however at a more moderate pace compared to the explosive increases of 2023 and 2024. According to a report by CNN, published on January 1, strategists anticipate a 14.8% increase in the S&P 500 for 2025, which is significant but lower than the previous years\u2019 performances. The Index saw gains of approximately 23% in 2024 and 24% in 2023. As per the report 2025 marks a return to typical growth rates after an extraordinary period of high returns, which has not been seen since the late 1990s.\n\nWhile several factors are expected to contribute to the market growth, there are potential risks that can hinder it. One of the key factors contributing to growth is the anticipated business-friendly policies under President-elect Donald Trump. Dan Ives, who is a technology senior analyst at Wedbush Securities in his December 30 note mentioned his expectations that tech stocks can rise 25% in 2025 due to less regulation under the Trump administration. The analyst has picked Technology and Artificial Intelligence (AI) stocks as his best performers for the year.\n\nOn the other hand, there are potential risks that could negatively impact the stock market. For instance, the uncertainty surrounding Trump\u2019s policy decisions may create a volatile environment for markets. Traders are particularly wary of how proposed tariffs could affect economic stability and investor confidence. David Sekera from Morningstar emphasizes that the implementation of tariffs is a significant wildcard that could sway market performance in either direction. We recently covered the analysis of Jurrien Timmer, Director of Global Macro at Fidelity Management & Research Company in our article titled, 12 High Growth International Stocks to Invest in Now. Here\u2019s a piece from our coverage:\n\n\u201cWhile talking about large-cap stock performance, Timmer raises the question of whether this trend of narrow leadership will persist. He suggested that trends continue to move in the same direction until a significant change occurs. Given that large-cap growth stocks have dominated for years, it is reasonable to assume that they may continue to lead. However, he also cautioned the investors that as per the concept of mean reversion, asset prices will eventually return to their historical averages and when this happens, it could lead to sharp corrections in stock prices. Timmer believes that while 2024 was a \u201cGoldilocks year,\u201d for earnings and valuations, this year can be a tussle between higher earnings and rising long-term interest rates, thereby resulting in a volatile market.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo get the list of the 10 best American stocks to buy and hold in 2025, we used Insider Monkey\u2019s third-quarter hedge funds database. Using the database we ranked the top 10 American stocks in ascending order of the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them.\n\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) The Best American Stock To Buy and Hold in 2025?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is an international provider of smartphones, personal computers, and other technology gadgets. Based in America, the company is renowned for its iPhone, Mac, and iPad. On January 27, Rosenblatt Securities reiterated their Buy rating on the stock, keeping the price target of $262. The firm expects the ongoing December quarter to be a bit low due to slower sales of the iPhone as it continues to face challenges from other Chinese manufacturers.\n\nManagement has been proactive in dealing with this competition. They released Apple Intelligence in June last year. The new artificial intelligence will be integrated with upcoming models to enhance user experience and act as a competitive edge over its competitors. Moreover, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has also shifted its focus on the Apple Store and its services revenue stream. As a result, the company was able to generate a record $25 billion in fiscal fourth-quarter revenue of 2024, indicating a 12% increase year-over-year.\n\nMar Vista Strategic Growth Strategy viewed Apple Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock positively due to investor enthusiasm for its AI roadmap and iPhone 16 launch. Here\u2019s what it is said regarding the company in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock was strong in the quarter as investors viewed the company\u2019s generative AI roadmap and iPhone 16 product cycle positively. The market was reminded of the strength of the Apple ecosystem as management demonstrated how generative AI solutions would be integrated into its iOS 18 operating system, which was broadly released in the iPhone 16 late in calendar Q3. We believe Apple\u2019s generative AI-enabled products should spur a meaningful iPhone upgrade cycle and create new avenues of monetization through its app store and advertising offerings. We believe this will support intrinsic value growth that will range between high single digits and low double digits over our investment horizon.\u201d\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 7th on our list of best American stocks to buy and hold in 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

While the overall market is predicted to grow moderately (14.8% increase in S&P 500),  there are conflicting factors.  Positive factors include a bullish outlook on tech stocks (potentially 25% rise) due to anticipated less regulation under a Trump administration, Apple's strong Q4 2024 revenue,  investor enthusiasm for its AI roadmap and iPhone 16, and a Buy rating from Rosenblatt Securities with a $262 price target.  However, risks include uncertainty surrounding Trump's policies, potential tariffs impacting economic stability, and the possibility of mean reversion in large-cap growth stocks, which could lead to sharp corrections.  The article also highlights the potential for higher returns in AI stocks compared to AAPL.

On the positive side, Apple is recognized as one of the top American stocks to buy and hold, with strong hedge fund interest (158 holders). The company's focus on AI integration, particularly with Apple Intelligence and the upcoming iPhone 16, is expected to drive growth and monetization opportunities. Additionally, the bullish outlook for tech stocks under a potential Trump administration, with less regulation, could benefit AAPL. However, there are concerns about slower iPhone sales and competition from Chinese manufacturers, which may temper growth. The broader market outlook for 2025 is cautiously optimistic, with moderate growth expected, but potential risks like policy uncertainty and tariffs could introduce volatility. Overall, the positive factors appear to outweigh the negatives, but the stock's performance will likely be influenced by both company-specific and macroeconomic factors."

        "headline": "ASML stock rises after earnings beat as CEO says DeepSeek will drive AI chip demand higher",
        "content": "ASML (ASML) stock rose as much as 5% in premarket trading after the Dutch semiconductor equipment company posted better than expected fourth quarter earnings and its CEO dismissed concerns that DeepSeek's latest breakthrough would hurt demand for AI chips.\n\nASML invented the technology required to make the world\u2019s most advanced artificial intelligence chips and is the only manufacturer of the complex machines \u2014 that latest version of which cost nearly $400 million \u2014 that use its EUV lithography technology.\n\nASML sells its machines to chip manufacturers such as TSMC (TSM), which uses its machines to produce chips for Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), and other tech heavyweights.\n\nThe Dutch firm on Wednesday reported earnings per share of \u20ac6.85, ahead of the \u20ac6.68 expected, and its quarterly revenue of \u20ac9.2 billion topped the \u20ac9 billion forecast, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates.\n\nASML\u2019s 2025 first quarter sales forecast also surpassed expectations, with its guidance range of \u20ac7.5 billion to \u20ac8.0 billion ahead of the \u20ac7.2 billion consensus estimate, per Bloomberg.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(ASML)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\n\"Consistent with our view from the last quarter, the growth in artificial intelligence is the key driver for growth in our industry,\u201d said CEO Christophe Fouquet in a statement.\n\n\"It has created a shift in the market dynamics that is not benefiting all of our customers equally, which creates both opportunities and risks as reflected in our 2025 revenue range.\u201d\n\nASML\u2019s results were under more scrutiny than usual after its prior quarterly earnings came in far below expectations and sent its stocks \u2014 and those of other chipmakers \u2014 tumbling.\n\nShares have been under pressure in recent weeks amid announcements of more restrictive export controls from the Netherlands and the US seeking to disrupt China\u2019s access to advanced semiconductors.\n\nWhile ASML has never been permitted to export EUV lithography machines to China, its sales of other equipment to the region have surged in recent years. ASML\u2019s revenue from China surged to roughly \u20ac9 billion in 2024 from \u20ac6.4 billion the previous year, per Bloomberg data.\n\nThe stock tumbled this week as news of a cost-effective AI model from Chinese firm DeepSeek cast doubt on the ultra-high spending from Western big tech companies on AI infrastructure, such as semiconductors made by ASML\u2019s machines.\n\nFouqet dismissed those concerns in an interview with CNBC Wednesday.\n\n\u201cA lower cost of AI could mean more applications,\" Fouqet said. \"More applications means more demand over time.

This positive sentiment regarding ASML's future, coupled with the exceeding of revenue expectations, indirectly benefits Apple (AAPL) as a major customer of ASML's equipment.  However, the impact on AAPL's stock price is indirect and likely less pronounced than the direct impact on ASML.  The news is positive but not a direct catalyst for a significant AAPL price movement.

Given Apple's reliance on TSMC for chip production and the positive sentiment around AI-driven growth, this news is likely to have a neutral to slightly positive impact on AAPL's stock.

The firm also tweaked its view on Apple's valuation and short-term growth prospects, cutting its previous $250 price target due to worries about the firm.\n\nThe EBITDA margin, however, climbed year on year, and Oppenheimer cut the fiscal year 2026 earnings per share (EPS) estimate by 4% to $7.95, below the consensus estimate of $8.23. Firm drops Apple revenue forecast to $438 billion in FY26 from $456 billion. The revisions were blamed on iPhone demand slowdown, and analysts lowered their projected shipment growth for FY25 to 2% from 5% and kept an outlook of 2% for FY26.\n\nApple's falling market share in China is a major concern: iPhone shipments in Q4 dropped 25%, and the full year 2024 fell 17% for the iPhone, Canalys said. With local Android manufacturers pressuring Apple's dominance, market share dropped from 19% to 15%.\n\nApple will likely struggle to maintain premium valuation and revenue momentum in the years ahead as it battles with competitive headwinds and sluggish iPhone sales, analysts warn.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

While the EBITDA margin increased, this positive factor is overshadowed by the substantial negative projections for revenue and EPS. The market's immediate reaction (1.5% drop) reflects this negative sentiment.  Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is significantly higher than a rise in the short to medium term. However, it's important to note that Apple is a large, established company, and the long-term outlook might not be entirely bleak.

        "headline": "What does the emergence of DeepSeek mean for European stocks? Citi weighs in",
        "content": "Investing.com - The emergence of DeepSeek could help bolster the case for investors to consider European equities, according to analysts at Citi.\n\nStock markets stabilized on Tuesday, but were roiled earlier in the week by a surge in popularity of Chinese start-up DeepSeek's AI model, which overtook OpenAI's ChatGPT as the top-rated free app on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s App Store in the US.\n\nDeepSeek said the model could compete with ChatGPT despite being made with less data and costing only around $6 million to construct. Although some have cast doubts around the claims, the announcement still raised questions around the necessity of massive AI spending plans being pursued by several mega-cap tech companies.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slipped on Monday, weighed down by semiconductor companies who have been recently boosted by hopes around AI-driven demand. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), the poster child of the AI boom, was one of the biggest decliners, erasing a Wall Street-record $593 billion off its market value.\n\nIn a note to clients, the Citi analysts led by Beata Manthey argued the ructions caused by DeepSeek suggest that while the enthusiasm around AI is unlikely to disappear, \"it could be evolving\". In particular, they said this trend could lead to earnings gains being less concentrated in the so-called \"Magnificent 7\" mega-cap tech companies, and even broadening out beyond the US.\n\nIndeed, the growth profile of S&P 500 members not in the \"Magnificent 7\" and the wider European market \"looks incredibly similar\", the analysts said. At the same time, valuations in the US are \"priced for perfection\", while European stocks are priced for more \"reasonable\" earnings growth expectations, they added.\n\n\"The pieces of the puzzle are coming together for better European relative performance,\" the Citi analysts said.\n\nAs a result, they view European stocks as \"the best cyclical diversifier\" in global portfolios, especially if worldwide economic growth \"stays on course this year\" and central banks continue to pursue interest rate reductions.\n\n\"[F]or global investors, the European index could be a relatively attractive proposition should returns begin to broaden away from mega-cap tech,\" they wrote.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nWhat does the emergence of DeepSeek mean for European stocks?

The overall sentiment appears mixed, with some analysts suggesting a broader market shift away from mega-cap tech stocks.

While Apple's App Store is mentioned as the platform where DeepSeek gained popularity, the core argument is about a potential shift in investment focus away from mega-cap tech companies (including those in the US) towards European equities. The news suggests that DeepSeek's emergence could challenge the dominance of existing AI models and potentially reduce the need for massive AI spending by companies like Apple. This could lead to a slight negative sentiment towards Apple as investors might re-evaluate the company's AI investment strategy and its potential returns. However, the impact is likely to be moderate as Apple's business is diversified and not solely reliant on AI. The news also mentions that the Nasdaq Composite slipped, weighed down by semiconductor companies, indicating a broader market reaction to the DeepSeek news. Overall, the news presents a mixed picture for Apple, with a slight tilt towards negative sentiment due to the potential shift in AI investment focus."

While DeepSeek's success challenges the narrative of massive AI investment being necessary, the article doesn't directly impact Apple's fundamentals or prospects. The main point is a shift in investment *away* from US mega-cap tech towards European equities.  Therefore, the news is indirectly negative for Apple, suggesting a potential for decreased investor interest in the company relative to other sectors.

        "headline": "Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) Among Kevin O\u2019Leary\u2019s Stock Picks for 2025?",
        "content": "We recently published a list of Kevin O\u2019Leary\u2019s Stock Portfolio: 15 Stock Picks for 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other Kevin O\u2019Leary\u2019s stock picks for 2025.\n\nTelevision personality, financier, and entrepreneur, Kevin O\u2019Leary, also known as \u2018Mr. Wonderful\u2019 is recognized mostly as one of the panelists on the reality shows Shark Tank and Dragon\u2019s Den. In 1986, the Irish-Canadian began his business career by launching the educational software company Softkey with $10,000 from his mother\u2019s investment and leveraging the proceeds from the sale of his SET share.\n\nWhen it comes to stock investing, Mr. Wonderful seeks names that meet three criteria: They must be quality companies that boast consistently strong financial performance and a solid balance sheet. Second, he believes that a stock portfolio must be diverse across multiple market sectors. Most importantly, however, he demands income, stressing that the companies he invests in should be ones that pay dividends to shareholders. The ALPS O\u2019Shares U.S. Quality Dividend ETF, an ETF offered by O\u2019Shares Investment Advisors, aims to encompass O\u2019Leary\u2019s strategies by holding stocks that combine all three of these characteristics. Since its launch, the ETF has returned 115.18% to shareholders. While high-risk, high-reward investments like those on Shark Tank or volatile assets like Bitcoin can be thrilling, O\u2019Leary believes that a focus on consistent, dependable income should be the basis of a sound portfolio.\u00a0 The venture capitalist summed up this view in a LinkedIn post:\n\n\u201cOUSA is part of the S&P 500, cherry-picking the highest quality balance sheets with positive cash flow from around 100 out of the 500 names. Then there\u2019s OUSM, which grabs the Russell 2000 and weeds out the underperformers \u2013 those companies not making any real dough. Forget Shark Tank, forget Bitcoin. Sure, I\u2019ve got a 5% stake in Bitcoin and another 5% in gold, but the meat of my US portfolio? It\u2019s in OUSA or OUSM.\u201d\n\nThe Race for TikTok\n\nFormer president Joe Biden recently signed a bipartisan bill that deemed TikTok a national security threat and required Bytedance, the platform\u2019s Chinese parent company, to either sell or divest from the platform completely in order for the social media platform to remain available in the United States. During a recent appearance on Fox News\u2019 \u201cAmerica\u2019s Newsroom\u201d, Kevin O\u2019Leary claimed to have made an offer of $20 billion in cash to TikTok\u2019s owners to purchase the platform, saying \u201cRight now, $20 billion is on the table, cash, cash, $20 billion.\u201d However, he added that the federal government wasn\u2019t able to verify whether the data of American account holders was actually being shared with Chinese leaders. That said, he believes the risk wasn\u2019t worth it. Moreover, in light of the dwindling timeframe, he said that companies are weighing the risks of maintaining the app\u2019s availability in the U.S., while keeping in mind the potential penalties for any provider who permits access beyond the cutoff date.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u201cAs of midnight on the 19, any service provider \u2026 that could be an Apple, that could be an Oracle, it could be a video compression technology company that\u2019s being paid as a consulting service, any of them that keep this thing alive is subject to $5,000 a day fine times 170 million. That\u2019s over a billion dollars a day.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nO\u2019Leary typically favors equities of well-established, financially stable companies with strong balance sheets and a history of consistent dividend growth. The following holdings are the top 15 from the ALPS O\u2019Shares U.S. Quality Dividend ETF (BATS:OUSA). For these stocks, we have also provided the hedge fund sentiment, as of Q3 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) Among Kevin O\u2019Leary\u2019s Stock Picks for 2025?\n\nCanadapanda / Shutterstock.com\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), a multinational technology company, is well-known for its flagship products, such as the iPhone, Mac, and Apple Watch, as well as its extensive suite of services, including Apple Music and iCloud. With approximately 2.2 billion Apple devices worldwide, the company has a sizable platform from which to launch its AI services.\n\nBernstein raised its price target for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) from $240 to $260 as part of its 2025 IT hardware industry forecast and maintained an Outperform rating on the company\u2019s stock. The company sees the names in its coverage universe primarily as trading stocks rather than long-term core holdings, and IT hardware as a \u201cstructurally challenged sector.\u201d Although many companies\u2019 portfolios are stronger than in the past, Bernstein predicts a more favorable environment for IT spending by 2025. However, it also notes that stock valuations are at the upper end of the spectrum, artificial intelligence profitability remains difficult, and it does not see much upside from a PC refresh cycle in 2025. As 2025 progresses, however, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) continues to be one of the firm\u2019s top picks for the year.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported $94.9 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2024, up 6% from the same period the year before. Product revenue increased to nearly $70 billion from $67 billion in the same period in 2023. In addition, the company distributed $29 billion to shareholders and reported $27 billion in operating cash flow.\n\nIn its third quarter 2024 investor letter, Madison Investments said the\u00a0following\u00a0regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL):\n\n\u201cAlphabet Inc., Eli Lilly and Company, Qualcomm Incorporated, Microsoft Corporation, and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) were the largest detractors. Apple has been volatile in the last quarter but ended on strength. Early in the quarter, Apple benefited from the introduction of their AI strategy, Apple Intelligence. They followed in September with the new iPhone 16, which also created some excitement. We are underweight to Apple, which has resulted in a headwind for performance.\u201d\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 4th on our list of Kevin O\u2019Leary\u2019s stock picks for 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

However, Bernstein views IT hardware as a structurally challenged sector and sees limited upside from a PC refresh cycle. The article also mentions that Madison Investments is underweight on Apple. Furthermore, the article suggests that other AI stocks may offer higher returns in a shorter timeframe. The TikTok situation is a neutral factor, as it doesn't directly impact Apple's core business.

Furthermore, while Apple reported strong Q4 2024 revenue growth and a high number of hedge fund holders,  Madison Investments' commentary reveals an underweight position due to volatility and a preference for other AI opportunities. Bernstein's positive outlook and price target increase are counterbalanced by their caution regarding the IT hardware sector's structural challenges and high valuations. Overall, the news is mixed. The positive aspects (strong financials, high hedge fund interest, price target increase) are tempered by the less enthusiastic assessment from some investors and the article's focus on other AI stocks as potentially better investments. Therefore, the probability of a price rise is slightly higher than a price fall, but the impact of this news alone is likely to be relatively small."

In an under-the-radar move, the smartphone\u2019s latest software update \u2014 released Monday \u2014 now supports the technology.\n\nThe tie-up comes as a surprise: T-Mobile has previously only specified Starlink as an option for Samsung Electronics Co. phones, such as the Z Fold and S24 models. Apple, meanwhile, already provides a Globalstar Inc. offering that lets consumers send texts and contact emergency responders when out of cellular range.\n\nT-Mobile has begun allowing customers to sign up for an early version of the Starlink service, and this week the carrier enabled a small number of iPhones as part of a beta test. In a post on X responding to the news, Musk said images, music and podcasts should be supported by current Starlink technology and future upgrades will add video support as well.\n\nThe first users received text messages from T-Mobile saying, \u201cYou\u2019re in the T-Mobile Starlink beta.

To start experiencing coverage beyond, please update to iOS 18.3.\u201d Users in the program have a new toggle switch in their iPhone cellular data settings to manage the satellite feature.\n\nAn Apple spokesperson declined to comment, while T-Mobile said that the test will \u201cbegin with select optimized smartphones\u201d and that the full launch will \u201csupport the vast majority of modern smartphones.\u201d T-Mobile has also opened the beta to some users running Android 15, the latest version of the Google operating system. A representative for SpaceX didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nGlobalstar shares fell about 11% in premarket trading in New York on Wednesday.\n\nEver since Apple teamed up with Globalstar to offer satellite features in 2022, there\u2019s been speculation over whether it might support competing networks. The day after Apple\u2019s 2022 announcement, Musk posted on X that his company has \u201chad some promising conversations with Apple about Starlink connectivity.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nHere\u2019s how it will work: When a T-Mobile iPhone is in an area without cellular connectivity, devices that are part of the Starlink program will first try to pair with SpaceX satellites. Users will also be able to activate texting via the satellite menu for the Globalstar service or contact emergency services through Apple.\n\nThe initial version of Starlink is exclusively for texting. But SpaceX and T-Mobile have said that they plan to expand into data connections and voice calls in the future. The program also is only available in the US for now. That contrasts with Apple\u2019s Globalstar service, which works in several countries. SpaceX is looking to expand Starlink to other carriers globally.\n\nThere\u2019s another major difference between the two services. The current Apple feature requires users to point their iPhone to the sky to find a satellite. The Starlink option, meanwhile, is designed to work automatically \u2014 even when the phone is in a customer\u2019s pocket.\n\nBoth the Starlink and Apple satellite features are designed to work in off-the-grid areas, such as hiking trails, that don\u2019t have cellular service. The capabilities can\u2019t be used in places where a mobile-phone network is within reach. Support for the Apple feature is available on most current iPhone models and the company plans to bring it to its Ultra smartwatch later this year, Bloomberg News has reported.\n\nT-Mobile updated its website this week to tell beta testers that the iPhone is supported as part of the iOS 18.3 software release. As of now, the number of users in the beta is minimal, with T-Mobile planning to expand the program in February. Apple\u2019s announcement of iOS 18.3 touted AI features and bug fixes, but it didn\u2019t disclose the Starlink support.\n\nSpaceX requested authority to begin beta-testing the service starting Monday. The Federal Communications Commission granted SpaceX conditional approval for its satellites to supplement T-Mobile\u2019s cellular network in November.\n\n--With assistance from Loren Grush.\n\n(Updates with Globalstar premarket shares in the seventh paragraph)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nWhat America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Indy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations The CDC Won\u2019t Give the Public a Full Picture of Fertility Treatment Risks\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments",

This collaboration may also position Apple favorably against competitors like Globalstar, which saw a drop in its stock price following the announcement. However, the immediate impact on Apple's stock may be tempered by the fact that the beta program is currently limited and the full rollout is not yet available. Overall, the news is likely to be perceived positively, leading to a higher probability of stock price rise than fall."

While it introduces a potential competitor to their existing Globalstar partnership, it also demonstrates Apple's willingness to innovate and explore new technologies. The Starlink integration offers a potentially superior user experience (automatic connectivity vs. manual pointing). The fact that it was kept under wraps suggests a strategic move. However, the impact is tempered by the fact that it's currently a beta program with limited availability and only supports texting. The negative impact on Globalstar's stock price suggests some investor concern about the long-term implications for Apple's existing satellite partnership. The lack of official comment from Apple also adds a degree of uncertainty. Considering these factors, I believe there's a slightly higher probability of a stock price rise than a fall, but the effect is likely to be moderate."

This could attract new customers and increase revenue streams, especially in areas with limited cellular coverage. However, the impact is likely to be gradual and limited initially due to the beta testing phase and the current text-only functionality.  The partnership with SpaceX and T-Mobile is also a strategic move, showcasing Apple's innovation and adaptability.  While this is positive news, the market's reaction might be muted due to the incremental nature of the improvement and the existing Globalstar partnership.  The 11% drop in Globalstar shares suggests some investors may view this as a competitive threat, but it's not necessarily a direct competitor to Apple's core business.  Therefore, a moderate increase in Apple's stock price is more likely than a significant one, and a price drop is less probable."

        "headline": "Apple's sales likely hurt by AI delays, Chinese competition",
        "content": "By Akash Sriram\n\n(Reuters) - Apple is expected to report tepid quarterly revenue growth on Thursday as its slow roll-out of artificial intelligence features and tough Chinese competition weighed on iPhone demand during the crucial holiday-shopping season.\n\nThe company and its rivals Google and Samsung have been leaning on AI to drive sales of their devices. But Apple's latest iPhone 16 series lacked such features at launch in September and some of its AI services, including an improved Siri, are only expected later this year in some regions.\n\nApple's challenges with AI were highlighted this month when it had to pull a news-summarizing AI tool due to inaccurate headlines, which drew criticism from the BBC and other news outlets.\n\n\"AI is the new technology innovation, the fact that Apple's handsets are lagging behind on capabilities is a key reason why their competitive positioning has weakened and the company has lost market share,\" said Jane Hepburne Scott, investment manager at Aegon Asset Management, which owns Apple shares.\n\nUnder pressure from a resurgent Huawei as well as other Chinese smartphone makers, Apple saw its share of the global smartphone market narrow to 23% in the final three months of 2024 from almost 25% a year earlier, according to IDC data.\n\nThe decline was steeper in China - its third-largest market - where Apple's share fell by 10 percentage points to 17%, the data showed.\n\nAlthough the Chinese government has been offering subsidies to smartphone purchasers to boost domestic consumption, these subsidies target low- to mid-tier phones priced below $800, excluding high-end iPhones, Barclays analysts said in a note.\n\nWorries about iPhone demand have weighed on Apple shares this year, dragging them 5% lower so far in January.\n\nAnalysts expect the company to post revenue growth of 3.8% for the three months to December, Apple's first fiscal quarter, according to data from LSEG. That is well below the 6.1% growth the company posted in the September quarter, which included only a few days of new iPhone sales.\n\nSales of iPhone will likely tick up 1.9% in the first quarter, weaker than the 5.5% increase in the previous quarter.\n\nMac sales are expected to rise 2.3%, slightly faster compared with the previous three months, while iPad revenue is expected to increase by 4.2%, a slower pace than the fourth quarter.\n\nThe services business, which has in recent years outpaced growth in Apple's devices, is expected to post an increase of 12.9% in sales.\n\nLike other companies with a large global presence, Apple is also set to be hit by a stronger dollar. The U.S. dollar strengthened by nearly 8% in the final three months of 2024 amid expectations for trade tariffs from President Donald Trump.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\"With more than 50% of sales coming from outside of the Americas, the strengthening U.S. dollar against the euro and yen in the December quarter could make it more difficult for Apple to report sales that are above consensus estimates,\" warned Tom Forte, senior consumer internet analyst at Maxim Group.\n\n(Reporting by Akash Sriram and Rishi Kant in Bengaluru; Editing by Aditya Soni and Saumyadeb Chakrabarty)",

While the services business is expected to grow, and Mac sales are projected to rise slightly faster, these positives are overshadowed by the larger concerns regarding iPhone sales and AI competitiveness. The fact that the stock has already fallen 5% in January suggests that the market has already started pricing in some of these concerns. Given these factors, the probability of a further stock price fall is higher than a rise."

                "reasoning": "The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the slower-than-expected revenue growth (3.8% vs. expected 6.1%) and lagging AI features compared to competitors are significant negatives, potentially impacting iPhone sales and market share, particularly in China, there are some mitigating factors.  The services sector continues to show strong growth (12.9%), suggesting resilience in other areas of the business.  The impact of the stronger dollar is a concern, but it's a macroeconomic factor affecting many companies, not unique to Apple.  The market has already priced in some negative sentiment, with Apple shares down 5% in January.  Therefore, while the negative news is substantial, the market's anticipation of weaker results and the continued strength in services suggest the probability of a significant price drop is lower than a moderate price movement or stagnation.  A substantial price rise is unlikely given the current headwinds."

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 January 29, 2025\u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Apple AAPL.\n\nApple Earnings: Should Investors Take a Bite?\n\nThis week's reporting docket is headlined by many notable companies, a list that includes beloved Mag 7 member Apple. Shares have had a rough showing in 2025 so far, down roughly 8% and widely underperforming relative to the S&P 500.\n\nBut can the tech titan's results push some life back into shares? Let's take a closer look at revisions and a few other key metrics to keep an eye on.\n\nEarnings & Sales Revisions Primarily Unchanged\n\nAnalysts have been quiet concerning their EPS revisions, with the $2.36 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate unchanged over recent months and suggesting 8% growth year-over-year.\n\nTop line revisions have been slightly more negative but have otherwise been stable since a downward adjustment in early November of last year. The $124 billion expected suggests 3.7% growth year-over-year.\n\nThe company's top line has remained rather stagnant over recent years. Apple's overall top and bottom line growth has been cooling for some time now, with it no longer recognized as the growth machine it used to be.\n\nKey Apple Metrics to Watch\n\nIt's critical to keep a close eye on Apple's China results, as the region has become a big thorn in the side amid a growth cooldown stemming from increased competition. The company's China revenue has fallen short of our consensus estimate in five consecutive releases, reflective of the struggles.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for China sales for the upcoming print stands at $22.1 billion, 6.5% higher than the year-ago figure and reflective of the first positive year-over-year change in several quarters.\n\nAnother key metric to watch in the release is Apple's Services results, which have regularly been robust and reached record levels throughout its latest period. The Zacks Consensus estimate for the metric stands at $26.2 billion, 14% higher than the year-ago figure.\n\nAnd last but not least, the company's iPhone results will be under heavy scrutiny. Apple has bounced back on the metric in recent quarters, as shown below, but Apple Intelligence will likely be discussed significantly.\n\nMany have remained skeptical of Apple Intelligence, and we'll likely get a good read on whether or not the technology and new features have led to greater sales. The iPhone remains the biggest top line contributor for Apple, accounting for nearly 50% of sales throughout its latest quarter.\n\nBottom Line\n\nBeloved Apple is gearing up to reveal its next set of quarterly results this week, with many other notable companies slated to report.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe stock is currently a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), reflective of bearishness among analysts. Commentary and guidance will be critical for the stock's movement post-earnings, likely dictated by the adoption rate and use of Apple Intelligence.\n\nIn addition to the iPhone's new capabilities, investors should also keep a close eye on China results and momentum within its Services segment, with the former suppressing growth over recent periods and the latter supporting it. Still, it's worth noting that China sales are forecasted to show the first positive year-over-year change in several periods.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

However, the article highlights the importance of Apple Intelligence adoption and iPhone sales, which are uncertain. The current Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) indicates bearish sentiment among analysts. Considering these factors, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a stock price fall due to the existing negative sentiment and uncertainties surrounding key growth drivers. The potential for positive surprises in China or with Apple Intelligence could mitigate this, but the overall tone leans negative."

The success of Apple Intelligence is also uncertain and will significantly impact the stock's performance.  The relatively unchanged earnings and sales revisions suggest limited positive catalysts. Considering these mixed signals, the probability of a price rise is lower than the probability of a price fall, although neither is overwhelmingly likely given the uncertainty surrounding Apple Intelligence and the overall market conditions."

        "headline": "Apple's $725 Billion Investment Is Fueling Its Growth -- and It Has Nothing to Do With Artificial Intelligence (AI)",
        "content": "It's a good time to be a bull on Wall Street. Since the start of 2023, the mature stock-driven Dow Jones Industrial Average, broad-based S&P 500, and growth-inspired Nasdaq Composite have respectively soared by 34%, 59%, and 91%, as of the closing bell on Jan. 24, 2025.\n\nInvestors haven't hurt for catalysts, with a softening in the prevailing rate of inflation, better-than-expected corporate earnings, and Donald Trump's return to the White House helping to lift equities. But topping the list of factors that have sparked this bull market rally is the ascension of artificial intelligence (AI).Image source: Apple.\n\nAlthough many of Wall Street's most-influential businesses have leaned on AI as a way to fuel their growth, one of Wall Street's biggest businesses, tech giant Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), has put $725 billion to work elsewhere to boost its bottom line.\n\nApple is one of Wall Street's largest businesses for a reason (and AI is part of it)\n\nApple was the very first public company to top $3 trillion in market value, and as of this past weekend was the second-largest company, behind only Nvidia. Apple has consistently led Wall Street higher for years -- and its success is no accident.\n\nFor starters, the iPhone is the premier smartphone domestically. Since rolling out the first 5G-capable iPhone during the fourth quarter of 2020, Apple's share of domestic smartphone sales has been 50% or higher. The ongoing upgrade of wireless networks to support 5G download speeds has led to relatively consistent demand for the company's iPhone.\n\nApple's innovation has also played a key role in sending its market cap to north of $3 trillion. This innovation includes physical products, such as the iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch, as well as its ongoing transformation into a platforms company.\n\nFor years, CEO Tim Cook has overseen the push to promote subscription services. By focusing on subscriptions, Apple has an opportunity to lift its operating margin, improve its already impressive customer loyalty, and smooth out the revenue peaks and valleys that often accompany major iPhone upgrade cycles. Apple's Services segment has been consistently growing by a double-digit percentage and now accounts for around a quarter of the company's net sales.\n\nLike most tech stocks, Apple is betting big on AI to power its top-and-bottom-line growth. Last year, the company introduced Apple Intelligence, which is its AI-driven personal intelligence model for iPhone, iPad, and Mac. Apple Intelligence can do everything from write and summarize text to create images for users.\n\nStory Continues\n\nLastly, Apple's balance sheet is cash rich, which allows it to aggressively invest in its future.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThis $725 billion investment has been crucial to Apple's profit growth\n\nWhile this confluence of factors has helped Apple become the company it is today, arguably the greatest driver of Apple's growth in earnings per share (EPS) hasn't been mentioned yet. I'm talking about Apple's single greatest investment: stock repurchases.\n\nIn 2013, Apple's board kicked off a share buyback program that quickly became the envy of the investing word. Here's a breakdown of Apple's repurchasing activity in each of its last 11 fiscal years (its fiscal year typically ends in late September):\n\n2013: $22.95 billion in buybacks 2014: $45 billion 2015: $35.253 billion 2016: $29.722 billion 2017: $32.9 billion 2018: $72.738 billion 2019: $66.897 billion 2020: $72.358 billion 2021: $85.971 billion 2022: $89.402 billion 2023: $77.55 billion 2024: $94.949 billion\n\nCollectively, Apple has bought back $725.69 billion of its shares spanning 11 years and reduced its outstanding share count by almost 43% in the process. To put this into some context, the $6.08 in EPS Apple reported in fiscal 2024 would have equated to just $3.47 in EPS if the board hadn't authorized any share buybacks.AAPL Shares Outstanding data by YCharts.\n\nAn ongoing share repurchase program serves a number of purposes for Apple. For one, as noted, it reduces the company's outstanding share count, which can increase EPS and make the company's stock more fundamentally attractive to investors.\n\nSecondly, buyback programs tend to incentivize long-term investing. When a company's outstanding share count declines by a considerable amount over time, it incrementally increases the ownership stakes of investors. When investors buy and hold, it typically reduces share price volatility, which can also make a stock more attractive to investors.\n\nAnd third, buybacks intimate that Apple's insiders (the board and management team) believe shares of their company remain attractively valued.\n\nNot even Apple's world-leading buyback program can mask these issues\n\nWith more cash than Apple knows what to do with on its balance sheet (and generated from its operations), there's no end in sight to this world-leading buyback program.\n\nBut just because Apple is buying back its shares at a breakneck pace, it doesn't necessarily mean its stock is a good value. Billionaire Warren Buffett has sold 67% of Berkshire Hathaway's stake in its top holding, Apple, over the trailing year (ended Sept. 30) -- and there are two good reasons why this selling is likely taking place.AAPL Revenue (Annual) data by YCharts.\n\nFirst off, Apple's physical product sales have stalled out for two years. Even though iPhone remains the top-selling smartphone in the U.S., stagnant sales of iPhone, iPad, Mac, and other wearables suggest consumers aren't being wowed by the company's physical products in the same way they have in the past. Though it's possible the incorporation of Apple Intelligence into iPhone, iPad, and Mac will turn these fortunes around, not even historically high inflation helped Apple grow sales of its physical product lines in fiscal 2023.\n\nThe other prominent concern with Apple is that its stock is historically pricey. Despite its aggressive share buybacks, Apple recently hit a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of more than 42, which is a level that hasn't been witnessed in 17 years. The stock market is itself pushing the envelope on the valuation front, and Apple's premium is even more pronounced.\n\nThough Apple's share repurchases are bound to continue, there's a lot of work to be done with the company's physical products before its current valuation makes sense.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

However, the article also points out concerns about stagnant physical product sales and a historically high P/E ratio, leading to Warren Buffett reducing Berkshire Hathaway's stake in Apple. The 'Double Down' recommendation is a marketing ploy and should be disregarded. Considering these factors, the positive impact of the buyback program and the negative impact of slowing product sales and high valuation seem to balance each other out. Therefore, a slight upward bias is given, but the overall impact is considered neutral."

Warren Buffett's significant reduction of his Apple stake further adds to the negative sentiment.  The high valuation and slowing sales growth outweigh the positive impact of the buyback program in the short term. While the long-term prospects remain strong due to Apple's brand strength and services segment growth, the current market conditions and valuation suggest a higher probability of a price correction in the near future. The overall market's strong performance in 2023-2025 is mentioned but is not directly tied to Apple's specific situation."

However, concerns include stagnant sales of physical products and a historically high P/E ratio, which may deter some investors.

        "headline": "Tech earnings ahead, Fed decision, ASML reports - what's moving markets",
        "content": "Investing.com - Nasdaq and S&P 500 futures ticked up on Wednesday, after stock markets stabilized in the prior session in the wake of sharp declines earlier in the week that were inspired by a new Chinese AI model. Several Big Tech names are set to publish quarterly results after the closing bell, while traders will also be keeping an eye on a Federal Reserve interest rate announcement. Meanwhile, Dutch chipmaker ASML (AS:ASML) reports solid demand in the fourth quarter and luxury goods titan LVMH unveils disappointing sales growth.\n\n1. Nasdaq, S&P futures higher\n\nNasdaq 100 futures and S&P 500 futures both inched higher on Wednesday, with investors looking ahead to key earnings from mega-cap tech companies and a Federal Reserve interest rate decision -- all while assessing the fallout from a steep sell-off earlier in the week sparked by a low-cost AI model from Chinese start-up DeepSeek.\n\nBy 03:30 ET (08:30 GMT), the Nasdaq futures contract had gained 96 points or 0.5%, S&P 500 futures had risen by 8 points or 0.1%, and Dow futures had dipped by 34 points or 0.1%.\n\nAll three of the indices ended higher on Tuesday. In particular, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite advanced by 392 points or 2.0%, recovering some losses logged on Monday which stemmed from fears that the emergence of DeepSeek's model could render massive Big Tech spending on AI unwarranted.\n\nShares in AI-darling Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) were among the main drivers of the Nasdaq, climbing by 8.9% following a sharp drop on Monday that wiped a Wall Street-record $593 billion off its market value.\n\n\"The consensus narrative aggressively pushed back on DeepSeek-linked negativity, [with] some dismissing the product and attendant worries about it having a detrimental impact on industry capex while others offered praise, predicting it would trigger an acceleration in demand,\" analysts at Vital Knowledge said in a note to clients.\n\n2. Tech earnings ahead\n\nFocus now turns to a raft of quarterly results from major tech industry players -- and recent stock market drivers -- this week.\n\nSoftware titan Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Facebook-owner Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), and electric vehicle maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) are due to report after the closing bell on Wall Street on Wednesday, followed by iPhone-manufacturer Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) on Thursday.\n\nThe four groups are all part of the so-called \"Magnificent 7\" collection of large tech firms which have underpinned strong gains in stock markets over much of the past two years.\n\nAI will likely be a central topic for analysts as they pour through the numbers, especially after Monday's DeepSeek-inspired rout in equities. Silicon Valley executives have previously stated their intent to shell out billions of dollars on developing their AI infrastructure, all in a bid to eventually monetize the nascent technology.\n\nStory Continues\n\nHowever, some doubts around the expenditures have arisen since DeepSeek's AI model, which was made with lower-capacity chips and for around a mere $6 million, shot up in popularity. Investors may be keen to hear what the tech sector's leaders have to say about the matter, analysts say.\n\n3. Fed decision\n\nThe Federal Reserve is widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged following its latest two-day meeting on Wednesday.\n\nIn a note to clients, analysts at ING aruged the Fed would need to see \"significant weakness\" in the American economy as well as lower inflation in order to justify cutting rates down from their current range of 4.25% to 4.5%.\n\n\"For the moment, the job market and wages are gradually cooling, but not enough for resuming easing,\" they added. According to market pricing, the conditions for a reduction will not be met until June, they noted.\n\nInstead, attention could center around Fed Chair Jerome Powell's press conference, with observers anticipating that he will be asked to comment on this week's stock market turmoil and the central bank's independence in the face of political pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\n4. ASML, LVMH report\n\nInvestors were buoyed on Wednesday by strong results from Dutch semiconductor giant ASML, helping sentiment following the global tech slump earlier in the week.\n\nASML's stock price soared 10% after the biggest supplier of computer chip-making equipment posted much better than expected demand for its most advanced tools in the fourth quarter, even as DeepSeek\u2019s low-cost model raises concerns over AI spending.\n\nElsewhere, shares in LVMH fell 4% as sales growth at the luxury goods giant failed to impress, following a string of solid returns from rivals and recent price gains.\n\nRemy Cointreau 's (EPA:RCOP) stock also dipped after the French spirits maker said it now expects the decline in full year 2024/25 group sales to be close to 18%, at the lower end of its guidance target, citing a lack of visibility around the timing of a recovery in demand in the U.S. and worsening market conditions in China.\n\n5. Oil muted\n\nOil prices steadied Wednesday after an uptick in U.S. crude stockpiles weighed on prices, adding to global growth concerns already exacerbated by the possible impact of President Trump's sweeping tariff plans.\n\nBy 03:31 ET, the US crude futures (WTI) gained 0.2% to $73.96 per barrel, while the Brent contract added 0.1% to $76.53 a barrel.\n\nUS crude oil inventories grew by 2.86 million barrels last week, according to data from the industry body American Petroleum Institute, after nine straight weeks of draws, as cold weather pushed up demand for heating and travel activity rose during the year-end holidays.\n\nThe Energy Information Administration, the statistical arm of the U.S. Department of Energy, is due to release its weekly report later in the session.\n\nOil benchmarks fell to multi-week lows early this week, dented by worries over increased U.S. production, the Trump administration\u2019s plans to impose trade tariffs on major economies, and weak economic data from China.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nTech earnings ahead, Fed decision, ASML reports - what's moving markets\n\nSwedish central bank cuts policy rate eying weak economy\n\nJapan to cooperate with Bessent on forex, other issues\n\nView Comments",

ASML's strong results also suggest continued demand for chip-making equipment, which is indirectly positive for Apple. However, the emergence of a low-cost AI model from DeepSeek raises concerns about the value of Apple's AI investments, potentially impacting investor sentiment. The Fed's expected decision to hold interest rates steady is largely priced in, but Jerome Powell's comments could introduce volatility. The disappointing sales growth from LVMH could signal a broader slowdown in consumer spending, which could negatively affect Apple's sales. Considering these factors, I believe there's a slightly higher probability of a stock price rise due to the overall positive market sentiment and potential for strong earnings, but the AI concerns and consumer spending worries temper the optimism."

Given the uncertainty, the probabilities are assigned relatively close to 50/50, leaning slightly towards a rise due to the generally positive market sentiment and Apple's strong historical performance."

However, there are concerns about AI spending due to DeepSeek's low-cost model, which might create some uncertainty.

Allspring Global Investments Senior Portfolio Manager and Head of Capital Allocation Margie Patel joins Market Domination to discuss the tech sector outlook as the earnings season progresses.\n\nPatel acknowledges that she expected 2025 to \"be a year of deceleration in growth\" for tech, adding that there is still \"uncertainty\" regarding DeepSeek's impact. However, she notes that historically, new product entries into the tech market tend to create increased demand, \"so everybody really benefits.\"\n\nAddressing valuation concerns in the tech sector, she points out that Big Tech PE ratios (price-earnings) have experienced \"erosion\" in recent months as investors worry about slowing growth and negative capital expenditure impacts.\n\nNevertheless, Patel remains optimistic, projecting 20% earnings growth for the sector in 2025, which would \"justify\" current valuations.

The market had a negative reaction to DeepSeek earlier in the week, indicating sensitivity to competitive pressures. The positive projection of 20% earnings growth is a significant factor that could drive the stock price up.

        "content": "Apple (AAPL) is advancing 4% today after a research firm reported that the company's iPhones were the best-selling smartphone in China last quarter. Earlier this month, another research firm stated that AAPL had dropped to third place in terms of smartphone market share in the Asian country.Dan Niles on Apple (AAPL): Data is \u2018Somewhat Disappointing\u2019 and Stock is \u2018Pretty Expensive\n\nAn Apple store displaying the latest in consumer electronics, from smartphones to wearables.\n\nThe iPhone Was Reportedly the Q4 Market Share Leader in China\n\nThe device's market share in China came in at 17.4% last quarter, the International Data Corporation (IDC) reported. That was slightly above second-place Huawei's 17.2% share. However, the device's market share was significantly lower last quarter than in Q4 of 2023, when it controlled 20% of the market. Further, for all of 2024, its market share dropped to 15.6% from 17.4% in 2023.\n\nLast week, another research firm, Counterpoint, reported that the iPhone's market share had been 17.1% in China last quarter, leaving the device in third place in the huge market. Counterpoint added that the number of devices handed over by Apple in China had tumbled 18.2% in Q4 versus the same period a year earlier. In Q4 of 2023, iPhone's market share was 20.2%.\n\nThe Recent Price Action of AAPL Stock\n\nIn the last month, the shares have fallen 4.5%, while they are up 2.5% in the last three months.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of AAPL, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

While the headline highlights a 4% climb due to IDC reporting the iPhone as the best-selling smartphone in China last quarter, the details reveal a more nuanced situation. IDC's report shows a slight lead over Huawei but a significant drop in market share compared to Q4 2023 and the full year 2024. Counterpoint's report paints an even less favorable picture, placing Apple in third place with a substantial decline in device shipments. The article also mentions that the stock has fallen 4.5% in the last month. Furthermore, there's a suggestion that other AI stocks might offer better returns. The initial positive reaction (4% climb) suggests some positive sentiment, but the underlying data and analyst concerns temper this. Given the conflicting information, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price rise in the short term due to the initial positive reaction, but the long-term outlook is uncertain. The negative data points and analyst concerns will likely exert downward pressure."

The discrepancy between these reports creates uncertainty.  Furthermore, the article highlights a significant drop in market share compared to the previous year (from 20% to 15.6% for the full year 2024).  The 4% price increase mentioned is likely a short-term reaction to the IDC report, but the conflicting data and overall decline in market share suggest a more bearish outlook in the long term.  The analyst's comment about Apple being 'pretty expensive' further contributes to the negative sentiment. Therefore, while a short-term price increase is possible due to market reaction to the positive report, the long-term outlook is less certain given the conflicting data and concerns about valuation."

        "content": "OpenAI on Tuesday announced a new tailored version of ChatGPT designed for US government agencies, a product launch that comes as the industry is still reeling from the breakout of a cost-efficient Chinese AI startup and as President Trump has urged tech companies to stay ahead of the competition.\n\nOpenAI says the new service, ChatGPT Gov, is meant to streamline the government's access to its models. And it will give staffers the ability to better manage their own security and compliance as agencies handle sensitive data.\n\n\"By making our products available to the U.S. government, we aim to ensure AI serves the national interest and the public good, aligned with democratic values, while empowering policymakers to responsibly integrate these capabilities to deliver better services to the American people,\" the company said in a statement unveiling the new tool.\n\nOpenAI says the special version of ChatGPT gives government agencies many of the same capabilities as its ChatGPT enterprise tool, including custom chatbots that employees can build and share and access to GPT-4o, OpenAI's flagship model.Last week, OpenAI was among a handful of tech companies backing a new $500 billion AI project, announced in a splashy unveiling by President Trump on his second day in office, dubbed the Stargate Project. Softbank CEO Masayoshi Son, Oracle chief technology officer Larry Ellison and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, attended the unveiling. (AP Photo/Julia Demaree Nikhinson)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nThe move further cements OpenAI's partnership with the US government, positioning its technology as a key asset for maintaining American tech leadership.\n\nLast week, OpenAI was among a handful of tech companies backing a new $500 billion AI project, announced in a splashy unveiling by President Trump on his second day in office. Dubbed the Stargate Project, the new AI company will be co-led by OpenAI and SoftBank, with key initial technology partners Arm (ARM), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and Oracle (ORCL).\n\nThe launch of ChatGPT Gov arrives just a day after the Chinese upstart DeepSeek roiled Wall Street and the tech world. On Monday, the surging popularity of DeepSeek's new R1 model, which vaulted to the top of app download charts, prompted a market rout for many of AI's biggest players. Nvidia, the chipmaker at the heart of the AI boom, plummeted 17%, alongside losses from other chip and tech names.\n\nThe team behind DeepSeek claims to have built the innovative model for a fraction of the cost of other popular AI assistants without the computing power of the most advanced chips available to US firms.\n\nThe broader implication of DeepSeek's success is that it undermines the model of massive investment that American tech giants are pursuing in the AI arms race. But some analysts have questioned whether DeepSeek has disclosed the true cost of R1's development and if DeepSeek actually has more advanced chips than initially thought.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDespite the initial panic on Wall Street, some market observers say heightened competition will actually increase industry spending and lead to further innovation. Meta (META) and Apple (AAPL), for instance, gained ground during the sell-off, on the belief that their platforms would benefit from more cost-effective models and cheaper ways of running them. President Trump called DeepSeek's arrival a \"wake-up call\" for the industry.\n\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

This implies that Apple might see increased efficiency and potentially lower costs in developing its own AI initiatives.  The overall sentiment is cautiously optimistic for Apple, as the DeepSeek threat is framed as a potential catalyst for innovation and cost reduction, rather than a direct threat to Apple's core business.

        "headline": "Why DeepSeek has been so unsettling for the stock market in 3 charts",
        "content": "A cheaper, competitive AI model from Chinese artificial intelligence company DeepSeek sparked a sell-off in the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) on Monday as it challenged one of the key drivers of the current bull market.\n\nFor the first time in a while, investors had a tangible reason to believe some US tech giants, namely Nvidia (NVDA) and Broadcom (AVGO), might not grow earnings by as much as initially hoped in the coming year. The team behind DeepSeek, the artificial intelligence model maker, claimed that the technology uses cheaper chips and less data. Investors are concerned this could hurt future AI chip sales for a company like Nvidia as well as bring into question the dominance of US hyperscalers in AI.\n\nThe problem for markets is that Big Tech's earnings beats have been driving stocks higher over the past two years.\n\n\"The key pillar of this bull market is earning estimates moving higher,\" Truist co-chief investment officer Keith Lerner told Yahoo Finance.\n\nHe added, \"Tech is at the forefront of the overall return for the market this year.\"\n\nAs Barclays head of US equity strategy Venu Krishna pointed out in Yahoo Finance's latest Chartbook, Big Tech earnings from the giants \u2014 Nvidia, Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT) \u2014 have seen earnings estimates rise more than the rest of the S&P 500 and the MSCI Europe (IEUR) index over the past 12 months.\n\nYesterday's more than 3% decline in the Nasdaq and 1.5% drop in the S&P 500 show how the market could react if both the blue (Big Tech earnings estimates) and green lines (the rest of S&P 500 estimates) in Krishna's chart below begin reversing direction.\n\nThe expected scrutiny over tech earnings will come amid a market that Richard Bernstein, CEO of Richard Bernstein Advisors, told Yahoo Finance is ripe for change. Bernstein'scontribution to Yahoo Finance's Chartbook showed how just 29% of stocks in the S&P 500 outperformed the index in 2024 and 30% outperformed in 2023. This marked the lowest number of outperformers since the late 1990s.\n\n\"It\u2019s probably incorrect that there is a new paradigm in which the 'Magnificent Seven' secularly dominate the market,\" Bernstein said. \"Such extreme, narrow leadership is rare because it goes against capitalism, open markets, and competition.\"\n\n\"We think 2025 [will] be a year of returning to normal broader markets as speculation meets reduced liquidity and fundamental investing again outperforms.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nBernstein's call for broader returns in 2025 matches the takeaway from a chart shared with Yahoo Finance by Nicole Inui, HSBC's head of equity research for the Americas. Inui's chart shows that while Magnificent Seven earnings are still expected to grow more than the other 493 stocks in the index in 2025, the gap is expected to narrow, making the case for a broadening of the stock market rally.\n\n\"Mag 7, while still outpacing the overall index on earnings growth, is expected to be less of an outlier.\"\n\nTo both Bernstein and Inui's credit, that market action played out on Monday. Roughly 70% of stocks in the S&P 500 closed in the green, despite a more than 1.5% drop in the index itself. Nvidia's large losses led to most of the downside action in the overall index.\n\nThis introduces a stark reality for investors. Should Big Tech's dominance wane, it might become a better environment for stock pickers to find names that could outperform the S&P 500. But it also likely means that the massive gains seen for the broader indexes over the past two years won't come as swiftly if the largest companies in the index aren't leading the charge.Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on Jan. 15, 2025, in New York City.

While Apple is mentioned as part of the 'Magnificent Seven' and Big Tech, the direct impact on Apple is less clear than on companies directly involved in AI chip manufacturing. The article suggests a potential shift away from Big Tech dominance and a broadening of market performance. This could be both a positive and negative for Apple. A broader market could mean more opportunities for other companies to outperform, potentially drawing investor attention away from Apple. However, it could also mean that Apple's stock is less tied to the overall performance of the 'Magnificent Seven' and more driven by its own fundamentals. Given the uncertainty and the fact that the news primarily targets AI chip manufacturers, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability of a stock price fall, but not dramatically so, as Apple's diverse product portfolio and strong brand provide some insulation."

While the article doesn't directly address Apple's specific vulnerabilities, the overall market reaction (Nasdaq down over 3%, S&P 500 down 1.5%) and the concern about slowing Big Tech earnings growth suggest a negative impact on the broader tech sector.  Apple, as a major tech company, is likely to be affected indirectly through decreased investor confidence in the sector and potential downward revisions to earnings expectations.  However, Apple's diverse product portfolio and strong brand loyalty might mitigate the negative impact to some extent. The article also highlights a potential shift towards broader market participation, suggesting that the outsized gains of the 'Magnificent Seven' (including Apple) might slow down.  Considering these factors, a moderate probability of a price fall is more likely than a significant rise, but the impact is likely to be less severe than for companies more directly involved in AI chip manufacturing."

Apple (AAPL) is part of the 'Magnificent Seven,' which has been a key driver of market gains. The news suggests a potential narrowing of earnings growth gaps between these giants and the rest of the market, which could reduce their leadership role. Given the market's reaction (Nasdaq down 3%, S&P 500 down 1.5%) and the broader sentiment shift, Apple's stock price is likely to face downward pressure in the short term.

        "content": "Chip stocks tick back up in Tuesday's pre-market trading, a first step in recovering from Monday's DeepSeek AI-driven tech sell-off. The ripple effect the Chinese startup's newest artificial intelligence model had on the wider landscape has left investors concerned about Big Tech's spending on AI and potential overconcentration in the sector as a whole.\n\nT. Rowe Price's Global Technology Fund portfolio manager Dom Rizzo joins Morning Brief to suggest that while short-term consolidation may occur, the medium-term outlook remains strong after the DeepSeek shakeup.\n\n\"Well, if you think about what's happened, DeepSeek really gave this incredible innovation to the world in terms of model efficiency by open-sourcing their V3 and their R1 models\u2026 And quite naturally, the first market reaction is, 'oh my gosh, GPU utilization is getting better, memory utilization is getting more efficient.' That must mean that AI spending goes down.\"\n\nWhile the DeepSeek reaction \"actually implies that compute intensity and GPU intensity could go up [in the medium term],\" Rizzo states. \"So I think it still remains to be seen.\" Related Videos\n\n05:24\n\nAre markets overreacting to DeepSeek AI or is Big Tech 'stretched'?\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 17 hours ago 02:11\n\nTrump Admin Continues Military Deportation Flights Despite Resistance\n\nWSJ \u2022 17 hours ago 02:53\n\nTrump's tariff threats work with Colombia, but China may be trickier\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 21 hours ago 02:01\n\nHow Trump\u2019s immigration policies could impact the economy\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 20 hours ago\n\nHe also highlights that the future and rate of AI spending is really \"a business model question\" for the biggest hyperscalers.

        "content": "This week\u2019s reporting docket is headlined by many notable companies, a list that includes beloved Mag 7 member Apple AAPL. Shares have had a rough showing in 2025 so far, down roughly 8% and widely underperforming relative to the S&P 500.\n\nBut can the tech titan\u2019s results push some life back into shares? Let\u2019s take a closer look at revisions and a few other key metrics to keep an eye on.\n\nEarnings & Sales Revisions Primarily Unchanged\n\nAnalysts have been quiet concerning their EPS revisions, with the $2.36 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate unchanged over recent months and suggesting 8% growth year-over-year.\n\nTop line revisions have been slightly more negative but have otherwise been stable since a downward adjustment in early November of last year. The $124 billion expected suggests 3.7% growth year-over-year.\n\nAs shown below, the company\u2019s top line has remained rather stagnant over recent years. Apple\u2019s overall top and bottom line growth has been cooling for some time now, with it no longer recognized as the growth machine it used to be.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nKey Apple Metrics to Watch\n\nIt\u2019s critical to keep a close eye on Apple\u2019s China results, as the region has become a big thorn in the side amid a growth cooldown stemming from increased competition. The company\u2019s China revenue has fallen short of our consensus estimate in five consecutive releases, reflective of the struggles.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for China sales for the upcoming print stands at $22.1 billion, 6.5% higher than the year-ago figure and reflective of the first positive year-over-year change in several quarters.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAnother key metric to watch in the release is Apple\u2019s Services results, which have regularly been robust and reached record levels throughout its latest period. The Zacks Consensus estimate for the metric stands at $26.2 billion, 14% higher than the year-ago figure.\n\nAs shown below, the company has regularly exceeded expectations on the metric, with the one exception coming in its latest print.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAnd last but not least, the company\u2019s iPhone results will be under heavy scrutiny. Apple has bounced back on the metric in recent quarters, as shown below, but Apple Intelligence will likely be discussed significantly.\n\nMany have remained skeptical of Apple Intelligence, and we\u2019ll likely get a good read on whether or not the technology and new features have led to greater sales. The iPhone remains the biggest top line contributor for Apple, accounting for nearly 50% of sales throughout its latest quarter.\n\nStory Continues\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nBeloved Apple AAPL is gearing up to reveal its next set of quarterly results this week, with many other notable companies slated to report.\n\nThe stock is currently a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), reflective of bearishness among analysts. Commentary and guidance will be critical for the stock\u2019s movement post-earnings, likely dictated by the adoption rate and use of Apple Intelligence.\n\nIn addition to the iPhone\u2019s new capabilities, investors should also keep a close eye on China results and momentum within its Services segment, with the former suppressing growth over recent periods and the latter supporting it. Still, it\u2019s worth noting that China sales are forecasted to show the first positive year-over-year change in several periods.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

While there are some positive expectations for China sales and Services revenue, the overall growth has been stagnant, and the lack of revisions in EPS suggests limited optimism. The upcoming earnings report will be critical, but the mixed signals and recent performance indicate a higher likelihood of a price decline."

China sales have been a drag, but are projected to improve. Services are a strong point, but iPhone sales and the adoption of Apple Intelligence are key uncertainties. The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) indicates bearish sentiment. Overall, the negative factors (bearish analyst sentiment, slowing growth, China concerns) slightly outweigh the potential positives (Services growth, potential iPhone rebound, improved China sales). Therefore, a slight downward pressure on the stock price is more likely."

Apple's overall growth has cooled, China revenue has been consistently underperforming, and the success of Apple Intelligence remains uncertain.  The stock has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), indicating bearish analyst sentiment.  The positive forecast for China sales is a potential upside, but the overall picture is cautious.  Considering the mixed signals and the bearish analyst sentiment, the probability of a price fall is slightly higher than a price rise."

However, the overall top and bottom line growth has been cooling, and the stock is currently rated as a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), reflecting bearish sentiment among analysts. The key metrics to watch include China results, Services growth, and the impact of Apple Intelligence on iPhone sales. Given the stagnant revenue growth, underperformance relative to the S&P 500, and bearish analyst sentiment, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise. However, positive surprises in China or Services could offset some of the negativity."

The company's expected EPS growth of 8% year-over-year and revenue growth of 3.7% year-over-year are positive signs. However, investors are concerned about Apple's growth cooldown, particularly in China, where revenue has fallen short of expectations for five consecutive quarters. On the other hand, Apple's Services segment has been robust, with a 14% year-over-year growth expectation. The iPhone's performance and the adoption rate of Apple Intelligence will also be crucial in determining the stock's movement post-earnings.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 January 28, 2025 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Apple AAPL, Dell Technologies DELL, HP HPQ and Microsoft MSFT.\n\nHere are highlights from Monday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\n\nBuy, Sell or Hold Apple Stock? Key Tips Ahead of Q1 Earnings\n\nAppleis set to report its first-quarter fiscal 2025 results on Jan. 30.\n\nFind the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nApple expects the December quarter's (first-quarter fiscal 2025) revenues to grow low to mid-single digits on a year-over-year basis. Apple's fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 net sales increased 6.1% year over year to $94.93 billion.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal first-quarter revenues is currently pegged at $124.04 billion, indicating growth of 3.73% year over year.\n\nThe consensus mark for earnings is currently pegged at $2.36 per share, unchanged over the past 30 days. The figure indicates a 8.26% increase from the year-ago quarter.\n\nAAPL's earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the earnings surprise being 5.05%, on average.\n\nLet's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.\n\nApple's iPhone Sales Likely to Fall in Fiscal Q1\n\nApple's fortunes are heavily reliant on the iPhone, which is by far its biggest revenue contributor. The device accounted for 48.7% of net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, wherein sales increased 5.5% year over year to $46.22 billion.\n\niPhone sales are likely to have suffered from stiff competition in China from Chinese vendors, including Huawei and Xiaomi. A delay in the launch of Apple Intelligence to a major part of Apple's installed base has been a concern.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal first-quarter iPhone net sales is pegged at $69.189 billion, suggesting 0.7% year-over-year decline.\n\nAAPL's Services Growth to Remain Steady in Fiscal Q1\n\nThe weakness in iPhone sales is expected to be partially negated by the steady growth of the Services segment. An expanding paid subscriber base has been a key catalyst for the Services business, which is riding on the increasing popularity of the App Store and an expanding installed base of devices, albeit with a worsening regulatory environment.\n\nApple has more than 1 billion paid subscribers across its Services portfolio, offering Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple News+, Apple Card, Apple Fitness+ and Apple One bundle.\n\nStory Continues\n\nFor the Services segment, Apple expects a double-digit growth rate similar to fiscal 2024. The consensus mark for Services is currently pegged at $26.176 billion, suggesting 13.2% growth on a year-over-year basis.\n\nApple's Mac Sales to Rise Y/Y\n\nApple's Mac shipment is expected to have increased 17.3% year over year in the fourth quarter of calendar 2024, per IDC data. The iPhone maker is estimated to have shipped 7 million Macs, grabbing a market share of 10.1% compared with 8.8% in the year-ago quarter.\n\nApple's estimated shipment growth rate is the largest in IDC's vendor list, followed by ASUS and Lenovo's growth of 11.7% and 4.8%, respectively. Dell Technologies and HP saw a shipment decline of 0.2% and 1.7%, respectively.\n\nIn terms of market share, Lenovo maintained the #1 position with 24.5%, trailed by HP and Dell Technologies' 19.9% and 14.4%, respectively. Apple's market share improved from 8.8% in the year-ago quarter to 10.1%.\n\nIDC estimates 68.9 million sold units in the fourth quarter of 2024, up 1.8% year over year. In contrast, Gartner estimates shipment of 64.4 million units, up 1.4% year over year. In Gartner's list, ASUS gains the most in terms of shipments (up 9.8%), followed by Apple (shipments up 4.6%).\n\nAAPL Shares Underperform Sector\n\nApple shares have returned 16.2%, underperforming the Zacks Computer & Technology sector's return of 27.5%.\n\nApple stock is not so cheap, as the Value Score of F suggests a stretched valuation at this moment.\n\nIn terms of the forward 12-month Price/Earnings, AAPL is trading at 28.97X, higher than the Zacks Computer & Technology sector's 27.54X.\n\nAI Focus Aids AAPL's Prospects\n\nAAPL has been on the investors' radar thanks to its AI push with the introduction of Apple Intelligence, an advanced personal intelligence system seamlessly integrated into iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and macOS Sequoia.\n\nApple's AI push is expected to bring consumer-focused AI-enabled PCs into the market, thereby aiding PC shipments in the long haul.\n\nAAPL has been playing catch-up in the AI space compared with Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon, its peers in the \"Magnificent 7\" group. Following the launch of Apple Intelligence, its competitive position is expected to improve.\n\nLeveraging the power of GenAI models, Apple Intelligence aims to enhance user experience across iPhone, iPad and Mac by combining robust language and image understanding with personal context. This technology, powered by Apple silicon, promises to simplify and accelerate everyday tasks while maintaining Apple's stringent privacy standards.\n\nThe Services business benefits from the growing demand for Apple TV+ content and the adoption of Apple Pay. It recently expanded Tap to Pay on iPhone to more markets, including the United Arab Emirates, Chile, Japan, Canada, Italy and Germany. Apple Pay is now available in countries like Egypt and Uruguay.\n\nThe expanding content portfolio for Apple TV+ is noteworthy.\n\nApple \u2013 China Headwind Makes the Stock a Risky Bet\n\nApple's near-term results are expected to bear the brunt of the weakness in China. A delay in the launch of Apple Intelligence is a concern, along with reported bugs. A stretched valuation is a concern.\n\nCurrently, Apple carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which implies that investors should avoid the stock right now.\n\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

                "reasoning": "The Zacks analyst blog presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the company is expected to report low to mid-single-digit revenue growth, exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in the past four quarters, there are significant headwinds.  iPhone sales are projected to decline slightly due to competition in China and a delayed launch of Apple Intelligence.  However, the Services segment is expected to show strong double-digit growth, and Mac sales are anticipated to rise.  The Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell) is a strong negative indicator.  The article highlights both positive factors (Services growth, Mac sales increase, AI push) and negative factors (China headwinds, iPhone sales decline, delayed Apple Intelligence, stretched valuation).  Considering the mixed signals and the negative Zacks Rank, the probability of a price rise is lower than the probability of a price fall, although the overall impact is likely to be relatively small in the short term given the already priced-in expectations."

        "content": "Investing.com - Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is less exposed to the emergence of DeepSeek's artificial intelligence model than its other Big Tech rivals who have invested heavily in building out their AI capabilities, according to analysts at Baird.\n\nIn a note to clients, the analysts argued that the iPhone maker, as a \"leading\" manufacturer of consumer-facing products, is \"well-positioned\" to benefit from so-called generative AI \"without spending tens of billions of dollars on [large language models] or infrastructure\".\n\nAlthough the company is continuing to roll out its Apple Intelligence AI-enhanced service in its latest iPhone offerings, the competitive impact of DeepSeek's low-cost AI model is \"limited\", the analysts said. Indeed, longer term, expanding generative AI capabilities could catalyze a \"better cycle\" of product upgrades, they noted.\n\nDeepSeek, a small Chinese start-up, roiled global stock markets on Monday after it introduced a free chatbot it says can compete with the likes of OpenAI's ChatGPT, albeit with less data and at a fraction of the cost.\n\nThe firm said it took a mere two months and under $6 million to build out its AI model on Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s lower-capability H800 chips. DeepSeek's assistant, which is run on the model, became the top-rated app on Apple's App Store in the US on Monday, overtaking OpenAI's ChatGPT.\n\nAlthough doubts still surround DeepSeek's claims, the statement fueled worries that massive spending on AI by the US tech industry's biggest names was unwarranted. U.S. President Donald Trump said the company represented a \"wake-up call\" for America's tech giants.\n\nIn its fiscal fourth quarter, Apple said payments for property and equipment -- a gauge of capital expenditures -- rose by $2.91 billion to $9.45 billion. The amount was relatively more modest than the plans put forward by peers like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), partly because Apple uses third-party data centers for some of its AI work.\n\nApple is due to report its December quarter results after the closing bell on Wall Street on Thursday.\n\n(Reuters contributed reporting.)\n\nRelated Articles\n\nApple \"well-positioned\" to benefit from AI despite DeepSeek emergence, Baird says\n\nNextEra Energy's XPLR Infrastructure shares tank on dividend suspension\n\nS&P, Nasdaq eye higher open as AI stocks recover, earnings roll in\n\nView Comments",

                "reasoning": "The news indicates that Apple is well-positioned to benefit from AI advancements without the heavy investments that other tech giants are making. Analysts from Baird suggest that Apple's exposure to the competitive threat posed by DeepSeek is limited, which could positively influence investor sentiment.

                "reasoning": "The news is generally positive for Apple. Baird's analysis suggests Apple is well-positioned to benefit from AI without massive capital expenditure, mitigating concerns about DeepSeek's emergence. The article highlights Apple's strategic advantage in leveraging generative AI for product upgrades. While DeepSeek's app topping the App Store is a point of competition, the overall sentiment is that Apple's approach to AI is sustainable and potentially more profitable in the long run. The upcoming earnings report adds another layer of uncertainty, but the Baird analysis provides a positive outlook. Given the positive sentiment and strategic positioning, a rise in stock price is more likely than a fall. However, the market's reaction to DeepSeek and the upcoming earnings report introduce some uncertainty, preventing a very high probability of a rise."

                "reasoning": "Baird's analysis suggests Apple is well-positioned to benefit from AI advancements without significant capital expenditure, unlike its competitors.  This is viewed positively, as it implies Apple can leverage AI opportunities while maintaining its strong financial position.  The emergence of DeepSeek, while initially causing market concern, actually strengthens Apple's position by highlighting the potential inefficiency of massive AI investments by other tech giants.  Apple's reliance on third-party data centers for some AI work is presented as a cost-effective strategy.  However, the overall market reaction to DeepSeek's emergence introduces uncertainty. While the news is generally positive for Apple, the upcoming earnings report holds significant weight, and any negative surprises could outweigh the positive sentiment from this news.  Therefore, the probability of a price rise is higher, but not overwhelmingly so."

                "reasoning": "The news highlights that Apple is seen as 'well-positioned' to benefit from AI without the massive spending seen in other Big Tech companies, which could be viewed positively by investors. The emergence of DeepSeek is considered to have a 'limited' competitive impact on Apple, and the company's focus on consumer-facing products and generative AI could drive product upgrades. Additionally, Apple's capital expenditures are more modest compared to peers, which may be seen as efficient use of resources. Given the positive tone of the analysts' note and the upcoming earnings report, the market may react favorably to this news."

The analysts at Baird argue that Apple's consumer-facing products and its Apple Intelligence AI-enhanced service will allow it to capitalize on generative AI without spending heavily on large language models or infrastructure. Additionally, the competitive impact of DeepSeek's low-cost AI model is seen as limited, and expanding generative AI capabilities could lead to a better cycle of product upgrades. This positive outlook, combined with Apple's relatively modest capital expenditures on AI, suggests that the stock price is more likely to rise than fall."

        "headline": "Apple Inc. (AAPL): Jim Cramer Explains Why It\u2019s the \u2018Quarterback of Your Portfolio\u2019 \u2013 Here\u2019s Why",
        "content": "We recently published a list of Jim Cramer\u2019s Bold Predictions About These 12 AI Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other AI stocks that Jim Cramer has made predictions about.\n\nGiven that AI has dominated stock market headlines for more than a year now, it\u2019s no surprise that Jim Cramer of CNBC\u2019s Mad Money and Squawk on the Street has also devoted quite a bit of airtime discussing the technology. He is extremely bullish on AI and has gone as far as to suggest that the world\u2019s largest AI GPU company, the one run by Jensen Huang, is ushering in a new industrial revolution.\n\nDon\u2019t believe us? Well, take a look at his own words. In a recent Squawk on the Street appearance, Cramer said the following about Huang and his company:\n\n\u201cIndustrial revolution, why can\u2019t we believe? Do you remember, did you read that, book about John Garfield, where they talked about the telephone, and Alexander Graham Bell tries to get it into the centennial in Philadelphia, and only because the Brazilian guy there doesn\u2019t get to represent it. And Alexander Graham Bell says you know this could revolutionize all of how we do things. And the American judges were like who is this clown?\u201d\n\nOne major AI announcement in January that has created quite a bit of a splash is President Trump\u2019s $500 billion Stargate project. Trump announced the project joined by executives from several big tech companies. Cramer believes that Stargate might end up underpinning industrial growth in the US. Stargate might also require the US to build the energy infrastructure necessary to support massive data centers. According to Cramer:\n\n\u201cCrisis comes down to the fact that we had no real industrial growth in this country for decades so we haven\u2019t had to build much energy infrastructure. Now all of a sudden these data centers start coming online like the ones that will be part of Stargate, the Oracle, SoftBank, OpenAI project\u2026 And these data centers consume insane amounts of electricity. It\u2019s a level of demand that nobody saw coming. So after years where we spent more time decommissioning power plants and building new ones, we suddenly gotta go back into growth mode.\u201d\n\nThese aren\u2019t his only comments about Stargate. Cramer believes that the announcement might underlie a new paradigm shift in the US ecosystem. This ecosystem blossomed through the partnership between Bill Gates\u2019 software company and OpenAI. However, Cramer believes that the shares of one of the world\u2019s largest enterprise resource planning companies soared after the announcement because \u201cmaybe because there\u2019s a reshuffling of the alliance. And the alliance could be in play.\u201d He believes that \u201cthe fluid nature of things here is rather extraordinary\u201d and that the firm might have replaced the software company:\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u201c[the ERP provider] might have replaced Microsoft in an OpenAI joint venture. This would be extraordinary. And you know Carl, I don\u2019t know whether Ellison [Larry Ellison] was doing a dance yesterday because he was so happy about this announcement. Or because he may have a real coup here. And betting against Ellison has been one of the biggest fools game in history. Man he was on his game yesterday.\u201d\n\nThe booming demand for energy from AI data centers has injected fresh life into nuclear power companies. Some of these firms are up by a whopping 186% year-to-date. While Cramer is skeptical about the near-term returns offered by nuclear power stocks, one energy source that he believes might become popular again is coal. Here\u2019s what he said in a recent Mad Money episode:\n\n\u201cUnder this president, coal could have\u2026 a renaissance. Sure, coal\u2019s time has come and gone, but it will come again because the data center inspired energy crisis really is so pressing that there\u2019s not really a choice anymore. Yes, the demand is that great, [and] we so foolishly mothballed good nuke plants that it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if coal\u2019s long decline may have finally run its course.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile our list of Jim Cramer\u2019s bold predictions about AI stocks, we scanned the stocks he mentioned in Mad Money and Squawk on the Street as far back as September 2024. Then, we picked out AI stocks and ranked them by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q3 2024.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Apple Inc. (AAPL): Jim Cramer Explains Why It\u2019s the \u2018Quarterback of Your Portfolio\u2019 - Here\u2019s Why\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nDate of Cramer\u2019s Comments: 09-05-24\n\nPerformance Since Then: 0.18%\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the largest consumer electronics company in the world. Since Cramer\u2019s comments in September, the stock has been flat and has added a negligible 0.18%. However, this doesn\u2019t mean that the actual performance has been lackluster. Between September and late December, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u2019s shares gained a respectable 16.5%. Since then, they have lost 14% on the back of analyst downgrades and a report suggesting that iPhone shipments in China fell by 17% in 2024. Loop Capital\u2019s downgrade to Hold from Buy with a $230 price target (down from an earlier $275) along with bearishness from Jefferies haven\u2019t helped the case either. Here\u2019s what Cramer said about Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in September:\n\n\u201cIn fantasy football, what you want is steady production and solid performance week in and week out. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve long said that Apple, the original \u201cown it, don\u2019t trade it\u201d stock, is like the quarterback of your portfolio. Last year, I said Patrick Mahomes from the Chiefs was the Apple of the NFL, and that analogy worked pretty darn well, as he led the Chiefs to their third Super Bowl victory in four years. Meanwhile, Apple is up more than 20%.\u201d\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 4th on our list of AI stocks that Jim Cramer has made predictions about. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

The article also mentions that while Apple is considered an AI stock, other AI stocks may offer higher returns in a shorter timeframe.

The positive aspects are largely based on Cramer's broader AI optimism and Apple's historical performance, not specific news related to Apple's AI initiatives.  The article itself downplays Apple's AI prospects compared to other companies. Therefore, the probability of a price rise is considered lower than the probability of a price fall, reflecting the recent negative market sentiment and lack of compelling positive news directly impacting Apple's stock price."

While Cramer's endorsement may provide some positive sentiment, the mixed signals (bullish long-term outlook vs. short-term headwinds) suggest a neutral to slightly positive impact.

        "headline": "Where the UK\u2019s ISA millionaires are investing",
        "content": "The number of investors with \u00a31 million or more in their stocks and shares individual savings account (ISA) is on the rise, according to Hargreaves Lansdown's (HL.L) platform data, which revealed where they are putting their money.\n\nThe UK's biggest investment platform said there were 1,322 \"ISA millionaires\" on its platform as of the end of December.\n\nThe figure was up 14% over the previous six months alone and was much higher when compared to the 168 ISA millionaires on the platform seven years ago, with just three recorded in 2012.\n\nHL found that the average age of an ISA millionaire on its platform was now 72 years old, down from 74 six months ago. However, the gender split of ISA millionaires had not changed from two years ago, with just over two-thirds found to be men.\n\n\"Some people get into investment in the hope of getting rich quick, but the vast majority of ISA millionaires have built a fortune through the far more reliable approach of getting rich slow,\" said Kate Marshall, lead investment analyst at HL.\n\nRead more: Key investment themes to watch in 2025\n\n\"They don\u2019t necessarily take enormous risks: many consistently invest as much as possible of their annual allowance, in a diverse and balanced portfolio, every year, for decades.\"\n\nMarshall pointed out that the top 10 stocks bought by this group were dominated by UK-listed blue-chip companies, including those that have traditionally paid strong dividends.\n\n\"It means most of them aren\u2019t speculating,\" she said. \"They\u2019re not in a hurry to trade them regularly either as, while most ISA millionaires traded in 2024, this has tended to be infrequent.\"\n\nAs for the most bought funds, Marshall said ISA millionaires were investing in a broad international mix of popular funds. Half of these funds were focused on a diversified mix of global companies, though there were also a couple of UK funds on the list, including an income fund.\n\n\"This reflects that as investors get older, some of the portfolio may have been reconfigured for income,\" she said.\n\n\"When you have a larger portfolio, you have more scope to add specialist funds into the mix, which is why we see a technology and India fund in the list of popular investments. Investors with a larger portfolio may be willing to take more risks, partly as they may have more scope for loss, or have sufficient stores of value elsewhere, such as cash ISAs, savings accounts, or annuities.\"\n\nHere's more detail on which were the most popular stocks and funds with HL's ISA millionaires.\n\nStory Continues\n\nLegal & General Group (LGEN.L)\n\nFinancial services company Legal & General Group was one name on the list, despite its shares trading nearly 8% in the red on a one-year basis.\n\nIn December, the firm said it was planning to return capital to investors and was on track to meet financial targets. L&G said it was on track to deliver mid-single digital growth in operating profit for the 2024 fiscal year, in line with guidance\n\nOperating profit in its half-year results came in at \u00a3920m ($1.14bn), slightly below the \u00a3924m it delivered in the first half of 2023. Profit after tax attributable to shareholders was down 41% to \u00a3223m.\n\nHowever, L&G raised its half-year dividend by 5% to 6p per share. The company's full-year results are due out on 12 March.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(LGEN.L)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nBP (BP.L)\n\nAnother big name on the list was BP, though shares in the oil major are down nearly 10% on a one-year basis.\n\nIn October, BP posted its weakest quarterly profit in nearly four years. The oil major reported a nearly 30% slump in underlying replacement cost profit to $2.3bn (\u00a31.85bn) in the third quarter. Underlying replacement cost profit is the metric BP uses as its version of net income.\n\nBP attributed the fall in net income in the third quarter to factors such as weaker realised refining margins and a poor oil trading result.\n\nRead more: Stocks that are trending today\n\nDespite worse quarterly results, BP announced a share buyback of $1.75bn as part of its commitment to announce $3.5bn in purchases in the second half of the year. BP also declared a dividend of $0.08 per share, though that is still much lower than its peak payout of $0.105.\n\nOil prices have been under pressure over concerns about weaker demand and geopolitical tensions, which has pushed brent crude (BZ=F) back below $78 per barrel.\n\nBP's fourth quarter results and its latest dividend announcement are due out on 11 February.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(BP.L)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nRio Tinto (RIO.L)\n\nMiner Rio Tinto also made HL's list of the most-bought stocks by ISA millionaires. While the stock is down nearly 12% over the past year, it recently ticked up slightly on reports that it had been in talks with Glencore (GLEN.L) about a potential merger, though discussions were said to no longer be active.\n\nIn its recently released fourth quarter production results, Rio Tinto said its mined copper production was up 13% in 2024 on the previous year.\n\nCEO Jakob Stausholm said in an interview with the Financial Times last week that US president Donald Trump will give the green light to the company's copper mine in Arizona.\n\n\"I do think that we have really good chances now to progress that project,\" he said. It comes after a long battle over permits for the mine.\n\nThe Resolution mine would be the biggest copper mine in North America once completed, capable of producing as much as 25% of US copper demand each year.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(RIO.L)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nISA millionaire top funds\n\nFive Legal & General Investment Management (LGIM) index funds were among those most bought by HL's ISA millionaires.\n\nThis included the Legal & General Global Technology Index Trust (0P000023MW.L), which tracks the performance of the FTSE World \u2013 Technology index.\n\nThe \u00a33.8bn fund is up nearly 38% over the past year, with its top holdings including iPhone maker Apple (AAPL) and chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA).\n\nAnother popular fund with ISA millionaires was Jupiter India (0P0000U20R.L), which has delivered a return of 24% over one year. This return was ahead of its target benchmark of the 13% return from the MSCI India index with net dividends re-invested.\n\nStocks: Create your watchlist and portfolio\n\nThe biggest sectors the fund is allocated to are financials and healthcare. Its biggest holdings include tobacco manufacturer Godfrey Phillips India (GODFRYPHLP.NS) and private hospital network Fortis Healthcare (FORTIS.NS).\n\nArtemis Income (0P0000KKC3.L), which invests in UK companies, was also named on HL's list. The fund has produced a return of 15% over one year, beating the FTSE All-Share's (0P00000CNT.L) 9.5%.\n\nFinancials also make up the biggest share of sector exposure in this fund, followed by consumer discretionary and staples firms.\n\nTop holdings include Pearson (PSON.L), which provides educational materials and technology, along with private equity investment trust 3i Group (III.L).\n\nRead more:\n\n6 crypto developments in 2025 that will keep fuelling bitcoin's rally Best fund picks for investing in a Trump 2.0 presidency Five ways to save on the cost of having children\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.\n\nView Comments",

Although the article mentions Apple (AAPL) as a top holding in one of the popular funds, it does not provide any direct information about the company's financial performance or future prospects. However, the fact that Apple is a top holding in a fund that has delivered a strong return (nearly 38% over the past year) could be seen as a positive indicator. Additionally, the overall tone of the article suggests that ISA millionaires are taking a long-term approach to investing, which could lead to increased demand for stable, dividend-paying stocks like Apple."

        "headline": "What to Expect in 2025 from Buffet's Apple Dump Last Year",
        "content": "Over 26% of Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio)'s Berkshire Hathaway portfolio is invested in Apple stock, which he has owned since 2016 and is still his largest holding; however, he has sold over 615 million shares of Apple in the past four quarters.\n\nOvervalued and Tax Concerns\n\nApple has traditionally been a high-flying quality stock with a vast moat, an exemplary capital allocation strategy, and a tactical product rollout. Still, the stock has been heavily overvalued since late 2023, with a current value hovering around 20% over GuruFocus's calculated fair market value of $189.29. Furthermore, Buffett's nearly 25% share reduction during September was more likely due to tax considerations. During the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting in May, Buffett stated that he expected future tax rates to rise.\n\nTentative with Technology\n\nAnother reason for selling may be that Buffett is less comfortable with technology companies than his late partner, Charlie Munger, as Berkshire started offloading shares shortly after Charlie passed away in November 2023. Before his passing, Munger emphasized the importance of owning stocks like Apple and Alphabet, acknowledging their dominance and consistent outperformance in the market.\n\nDominos Investment\n\nBuffett's Apple sales have generated nearly $25 billion, giving Berkshire Hathaway a large cash pile for other investments. Fifty-five million of that cash has been invested in high-quality Domino's Pizza, representing approximately 3.7% of company shares. This solid-value, non-technology franchise business may appeal more to Buffett than his existing overinflated Apple stock. The stock is trading slightly below Guru Focus's fair market value estimate of $428.28, with an overall score of 92 and a profitability rank of 10 out of 10. Domino's share price is expected to rise approximately 10% in the next 12 months versus Apple's, which is predicted to increase by less than 1%. Domino's fortressing strategy, global master franchise agreements, Pulse POS system, and recently upgraded customer loyalty program have helped the company expand globally and drive domestic carryout traffic. The company is the prominent market leader in the quick-service restaurant (QSR) pizza business and outperformed Papa John's and Pizza Hut (owned by Yum Brands) in 2024. The company has an impressive 56% ROIC, contrasting sharply with a meager 9.95% WACC, suggesting the company is effectively allocating capital and accreting value despite a heavy debt burden.\n\nDomino's debt burden is reflected in the company's long history of negative debt-to-equity and equity-to-asset ratios. However, these metrics align with Papa John's and Yum Brands in this competitive, capital-intensive industry. With its huge cash pile, Berkshire Hathaway's interest in the company may help alleviate investor concerns. Domino's paid investors a $1.51 per share dividend in September and has had a 20% dividend growth rate over the last 10 years. That policy may be questionable, given their negative equity history.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhat to Expect in 2025 from Buffet's Apple Dump Last Year\n\nDPZ Data by GuruFocus\n\nHere's how Domino's metrics currently stack up with competitors (Data as of January 17, 2025):\n\nCompany Domino's Pizza Inc Yum Brands Inc (Pizza Hut) Papa John's International Inc Symbol DPZ YUM PZZA Industry Restaurants Restaurants Restaurants GF Score 92 87 74 Morningstar Moat Rating Wide Wide Narrow Predictability Rank 4/10 1/10 1/10 GF Value Rank 7/10 9/10 4/10 GF Valuation  Fairly Valued Modestly Undervalued Significantly Undervalued Profitability Rank 10/10 9/10 8/10 Financial Strength 4/10 4/10 4/10 Growth Rank 9/10 7/10 5/10 GF Value 429.80 144.33 79.35 Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) 443.84 0.00 0.00 Price Target 483.07 144.17 57.73 Revenue 4,665.47 7,223.00 2,099.94 PE Ratio 26.27 23.42 12.50 PEG Ratio 2.07 4.36 0.61 Price-to-Owner-Earnings 27.96 28.81 16.89 PB Ratio 0.00 0.00 0.00 PS Ratio 3.22 4.94 0.56 Price-to-Free-Cash-Flow 30.09 26.10 23.93 Price-to-Operating-Cash-Flow 24.37 21.96 9.69 EV-to-EBITDA 20.00 18.28 8.91 Debt-to-Equity -1.31 -1.46 -2.23 Interest Coverage 4.41 4.74 3.11 Current Ratio 1.71 1.37 0.80 ROIC % 56.18 39.80 15.10 WACC % 10.06 7.66 7.66 Gross Margin % 39.05 48.57 20.25 Operating Margin % 18.49 32.19 6.58 Net Margin % 12.26 21.13 4.51 ROE % Negative Equity Negative Equity Negative Equity ROA % 32.99 24.31 11.02 3-Year Total EBITDA Growth Rate 5.50 13.30 14.10 Dividends per Share (TTM)  5.74 2.62 1.84 Dividend Yield % 1.41 2.14 5.11 Dividend Payout Ratio 0.35 0.51 0.70 FCF Yield % 3.38 3.91 4.20 Buyback Yield % 1.85 0.93 0.00\n\nApple's Short and Long-Term Prospects\n\nApple's stock rose more than 30% in 2024 and is trading at all-time highs. Many fear the stock may lose momentum, as reflected in Guru Focus's flat share price target for the next 12 months. However, Apple investors might not want to unload their stock just yet.\n\nNear-term prospects are mixed due to geopolitical risks related to Apple's supply chain in China and Taiwan. With Trump's return to office, we might see a continuation of his previous trade policies, which previously have included tariffs on Chinese products and stricter enforcement of trade agreements.\n\nApple also has antitrust concerns. Since Google is the default search engine on Safari, Apple has taken an interest in the Department of Justice versus Google case, which may negatively impact Apple's ability to provide premium products to users. Weakened consumer spending may exacerbate these problems.\n\nHowever, the release of the new iPhone 16, the Apple Watch Series 10, and AirPods 4 holds some promise that the stock may maintain a similar 2024 trajectory, including record revenues of 9.4 billion, a 6% year-over-year increase, and a 12% earnings increase. Apple is also developing a proprietary cellular modem, expected to roll out in 2025, starting with the iPhone SE and even eventually moving to premium models by 2027. This vertical integration strategy is expected to drive margin expansion.\n\nWith the adoption of Apple Intelligence, Apple's latest artificial intelligence system, introduced at the company's tradeshow, Worldwide Developers Conference 2024, dedicated Apple users are expected to upgrade their current iPhone models in 2026. The company is also expected to have an 11.4% compounded annual growth rate in service revenue through fiscal year 2027. For these reasons, Morgan Stanley forecasts a 12.3% revenue growth and earnings per share of $8.52 for 2026.\n\nThe Stalwart Parent\n\nCautious investors can't go wrong with Buffett's company, Berkshire Hathaway. Berkshire Hathaway shows moderate short-term gain potential with strong financial health and profitability metrics. Net margin, return on assets, return on equity, and return on invested capital indicate strong financial health compared to the S&P 500. The company had a record $325.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents at the end of Q3 2024, up from $276.9 billion at the end of June 2024. Berkshire Hathaway A and B shares are priced slightly above Guru Focus's calculated values. Investment income trends for the company remain strong due to increased bond reinvestment rates and Berkshire also exhibits attractive long-term prospects due to consistent revenue and net income growth, improved financial health, and a diversified business model. Berkshire Hathaway is expected to earn over $23.00 per share by 2027 through 2029 and may also continue to benefit from strategic acquisitions.\n\nHowever, there are a few cracks in the armor. Operating earnings were $4.68 per share in the third quarter of 2024, a decline due to decreased underwriting income from industrywide catastrophes. The company has a history of rising debt and inconsistent per-share cash flow within the last 5 years.What to Expect in 2025 from Buffet's Apple Dump Last Year\n\nBRK.A Data by GuruFocus\n\nIn November 2024, CFRA downgraded its rating on Berkshire Hathaway's Class B shares from 'Buy' to 'Hold,' attributing the decision to lower EPS estimates and revenue forecasts caused by widespread declines in operating revenues and insurance premiums.\n\nMorningstar lowered Berkshire Hathaway's moat rating from wide to narrow due to several factors. They observed signs of slippage in the railroad business and increased litigation exposure for the utilities/energy business, which have put downward pressure on excess returns for the noninsurance operations. Moreover, following Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio)'s inevitable departure, the company will likely find it challenging to replicate the historic advantages he provided, making it harder for Berkshire to achieve superior returns consistently over the next decade.\n\nBelow is a comparison of significant metrics for the three main companies discussed in this report (BRK.A & BRK.B refer to the same company but have slightly different metrics due to market fluctuations; Data as of January 17, 2025):\n\nCompany Apple Inc Berkshire Hathaway Inc Berkshire Hathaway Inc Domino's Pizza Inc Symbol AAPL BRK.A BRK.B DPZ Industry Hardware Insurance Insurance Restaurants GF Score 96 72 69 92 Morningstar Moat Rating Wide Narrow Narrow Wide Predictability Rank 5 Stars 1 Star 1 Star 4 Stars GF Value Rank 5/10 5/10 3/10 7/10 GF Valuation Modestly Overvalued Modestly Overvalued Significantly Overvalued Fairly Valued Profitability Rank 10/10 6/10 6/10 10/10 Financial Strength 6/10 7/10 7/10 4/10 Growth Rank 10/10 2/10 2/10 9/10 GF Value 189.76 564,060.75 353.49 429.80 Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) 144.50 0.00 0.00 443.84 Price Target 243.60 762,340.33 513.00 483.07 Revenue 391,035.00 452,954.00 452,954.00 4,665.47 PE Ratio 37.83 9.47 9.47 26.27 PEG Ratio 2.14 0.00 0.00 2.07 Price-to-Owner-Earnings 34.94 8.78 8.78 27.96 PB Ratio 61.05 1.61 1.61 0.00 PS Ratio 9.07 2.23 2.23 3.22 Price-to-Free-Cash-Flow 32.60 48.11 48.11 30.09 Price-to-Operating-Cash-Flow 30.00 25.06 25.06 24.37 EV-to-EBITDA 25.99 7.28 7.28 20.00 Debt-to-Equity 1.87 0.20 0.20 -1.31 Interest Coverage N/A 27.47 27.47 4.41 Current Ratio 0.87 0.00 0.00 1.71 ROIC % 32.51 10.65 10.65 56.18 WACC %  11.41 9.07 9.07 10.06 Gross Margin % 46.21 0.00 0.00 39.05 Operating Margin % 31.51 0.00 0.00 18.49 Net Margin % 23.97 23.60 23.60 12.26 ROE %  140.28 18.50 18.50 Negative Equity ROA % 26.93 9.87 9.87 32.99 3-Year Total EBITDA Growth Rate  3.00 25.10 25.10 5.50 Dividends per Share (TTM)  0.98 0.00 0.00 5.74 Dividend Yield % 0.43 0.00 0.00 1.41 Dividend Payout Ratio 0.15 0.00 0.00 0.35 FCF Yield % 3.15 2.08 2.08 3.38 Buyback Yield % 2.75 0.51 0.51 1.85\n\nGiven the current metrics of these three companies, Domino's appears to be the best value investment for those seeking a balance of growth potential and dividend yield. It is fairly valued with a significant expected price increase and offers a high dividend yield. Still, prospective investors should be wary of the company's high debt levels and negative equity.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway is the clear winner for more risk-averse investors. The company has low PE and EV/EBITDA ratios and a nearly 70% margin of safety based on GuruFocus's discounted cash flow model. Still, these calculations may be highly unpredictable due to the company's narrowing moat, challenges in capital allocation, and inevitable leadership transition.\n\nTake-Aways\n\nWarren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio)'s Berkshire Hathaway significantly reduced its Apple holdings, selling over 615 million shares due to concerns about Apple's overvaluation and future tax rates. This shift reflects Buffett's cautious stance on technology stocks following the passing of his partner, Charlie Munger.\n\nThe proceeds from these sales have been partially reinvested in Domino's Pizza, a high-quality, non-technology franchise that aligns more closely with Buffett's investment philosophy.\n\nDespite Apple's strong performance and promising product rollouts, its overvaluation and geopolitical risks present challenges. Meanwhile, Berkshire Hathaway faces headwinds such as decreased underwriting income, rising debt, and a narrowing moat, compounded by the impending leadership transition post-Buffett. Domino's Pizza emerges as a compelling value investment, offering a balance of growth potential and dividend yield despite its high debt levels.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

Despite Apple's strong product pipeline and historical performance, the current valuation is seen as excessive, with a fair market value estimated significantly lower than the trading price.

                "reasoning": "The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. On one hand, Buffett's significant reduction in Apple holdings due to overvaluation and potential tax increases is a negative signal. His shift towards Domino's, a non-tech company, further suggests a lack of confidence in Apple's future growth potential. Geopolitical risks and antitrust concerns also weigh on the stock. However, upcoming product releases (iPhone 16, Apple Watch Series 10, AirPods 4) and the adoption of Apple Intelligence offer potential upside. Morgan Stanley's forecast of revenue and EPS growth in 2026 provides some optimism. Considering these factors, the negative signals from Buffett's actions and the overvaluation concerns slightly outweigh the potential positive catalysts, leading to a higher probability of a stock price fall."

While Apple's future prospects are mixed (new product releases vs. geopolitical risks and antitrust concerns), the article highlights several positive factors, including strong revenue and earnings growth projections.  However, the significant sell-off by Buffett, a renowned investor, carries considerable weight and suggests a negative sentiment towards Apple's short-term prospects.  The article also presents a positive outlook for Domino's Pizza, which could indirectly impact Apple's stock price if investors shift their focus to other companies. Considering the conflicting factors, the probability of a price rise is lower than the probability of a price fall, but the fall is not expected to be drastic given Apple's strong fundamentals and future product pipeline."

The news also mentions geopolitical risks, antitrust concerns, and potential weakening consumer spending as negative factors. However, Apple's strong product pipeline, including the iPhone 16 and Apple Intelligence, along with projected revenue growth, provides some positive outlook.

        "headline": "Jim Cramer Addresses Concerns Around Apple (AAPL) and Why Consensus Estimates Matter",
        "content": "We recently published a list of Jim Cramer Discusses These 13 Stocks & Rejects The AI PC Super Cycle. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against stocks that Jim Cramer discusses.\n\nIn a fresh appearance on CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer commented in quite a bit of detail on artificial intelligence and AI PCs. AI, the technology that has caught the investing world by storm, has two facets. The first covers enterprise computing with cloud computing services such as Azure and AWS offering businesses new AI tools for their tasks. The second is the consumer end, dominated primarily via chatbots and services like the Chinese firm DeepSeek\u2019s R1 and OpenAI\u2019s o1.\n\nAnother aspect of AI that received quite a lot of attention last year was AI PCs. These computers use hardware designed to run artificial intelligence workloads. This hardware includes graphics processing units (GPUs) and neural processing units (NPUs), which means that their price tag is often higher than a standard computer.\n\nOn top of Cramer\u2019s mind was a recent Morgan Stanley consumer survey report which analyzed consumer sentiment with respect to a super-cycle in AI-enabled products. The bank revealed that just 15% of the 400 respondents bought some of the products primarily because they wanted to access AI. The bank added that 60% of respondents inadvertently bought an AI PC and more than 60% shared that they would not pay extra for AI products.\n\nCommenting on the research, Cramer started by sharing \u201cI think the AI hardware super cycle Morgan Stanley piece is perhaps the most damming piece I\u2019ve read.\u201d According to him, the research was striking \u201cBecause there\u2019s absolutely no evidence of a super cycle whatsoever.\u201d The CNBC host shifted towards enterprise AI use cases and was appreciative of them. \u201cI mean I think AI is very good when you listen to what Jamie Dimon [inaudible] to say, that AI is very good when you listen to what Marc Benioff has to say,\u201d he outlined.\n\nHowever, while AI has impressed business users, Cramer admitted to being wrong about consumer demand for AI PCs. \u201cBut the PC, I thought we were all gonna upgrade. And now we\u2019re all in wait-and-see mode,\u201d he shared. Cramer added that those he knew who have bought an AI PC \u201chaven\u2019t used it or there\u2019s a button there and it doesn\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nYet, even though consumer interest in AI PCs might be lackluster, Cramer is still an AI believer. He revealed that \u201cI use it [ChatGPT] every day.\u201d One ChatGPT use case he likes is comparing drugs. \u201cAnd you start at ChatGPT. You really do. And it\u2019s very authoritative and it tells you who to go to. And I think it\u2019s extraordinary. It\u2019s an extraordinarily good product,\u201d according to Cramer.\n\nStory Continues\n\nIn fact, Cramer\u2019s \u201con ChatGPT maybe five times before I come down here. Ten times before I do Mad Money. There\u2019s nothing I don\u2019t run through. Because I don\u2019t want to make a mistake.\u201d However, he did add that while ChatGPT is great, this doesn\u2019t mean \u201cthat it\u2019s not hallucinating.\u201d Yet, Cramer still suggests \u201c. . anyone use it before they buy a stock. It\u2019s that good.\u201d\n\nHis praise for ChatGPT isn\u2019t the first time that Cramer\u2019s shared opinions on AI. In a recent CNBC morning appearance, he outlined some enterprise AI use cases. Cramer shared:\n\n\u201cHealthcare\u2019s gonna be a very big, very big part of AI. David, it\u2019s not yet. And we need that, well-meaning people who believe in the industry have to have what people who are more than just trying to figure out how to make it so there\u2019s a call center that\u2019s better.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired on January 23rd.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Jim Cramer Addresses Concerns Around Apple (AAPL) and Why Consensus Estimates Matter\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u2019s shares have not seen much love from investors in 2025. Wall Street doesn\u2019t believe that the firm\u2019s consumer AI initiatives are attracting consumers and multiple reports have claimed that its flagship iPhone is struggling in China. Cramer has discussed Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u2019s stock several times this year. He believes that investors focus too much on the iPhone with regard to the firm\u2019s hypothesis and holds the opinion that the commonly held belief of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) missing upcoming earnings means that the miss won\u2019t be a surprise. Here are his latest remarks:\n\n\u201cAnother guy, the Goldman guy, said look, I\u2019m below the consensus. Well you know what the consensus is full of Apple. It doesn\u2019t matter anymore.\u00a0 The consensus is, like why don\u2019t we just get the consensus to move so when it disappoints, it doesn\u2019t disappoint as badly. And remember, what people always talk about, it\u2019s not this quarter. It\u2019s the \u2018estimate cut that I know that nobody else knows.\u2019 Everyone knows that there\u2019s going to be an estimate cut.\u201d\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 4th on our list of stocks that Jim Cramer discusses. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

He also mentions that the consensus earnings estimates for Apple are already low, implying that any negative surprise might be less impactful than feared.  However, the article doesn't present any overwhelmingly positive or negative news directly impacting Apple's fundamentals. The overall tone is neutral to slightly negative regarding consumer AI adoption, but positive regarding Apple's position in the enterprise AI space.

Additionally, the article mentions weak iPhone sales in China, another potential headwind. While Cramer remains optimistic about enterprise AI applications, his skepticism about consumer AI demand and Apple's current challenges suggest a cautious outlook for AAPL's stock in the near term.

        "content": "Investing.com -- The stock market suffered a sharp sell-off Monday, with the S&P 500 dropping 1.46% and the Nasdaq falling 3% after Chinese startup DeepSeek\u2019s AI breakthrough sparked concerns over lower AI-related spending.\n\nAnalysts at Bank of America believe that the pullback created idiosyncratic buy opportunities in certain stocks. They highlighted Corning Incorporated (NYSE:GLW), Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co (NYSE:HPE), Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC), and Seagate Technology PLC (NASDAQ:STX), noting that \u201ceach name has compelling growth drivers separate from Gen AI/datacenter spending.\u201d\n\nBofA also likes Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and IBM (NYSE:IBM), citing their defensive nature and potential for growth amid market volatility.\n\nApple is one of the rare technology stocks that rose higher on Monday.\n\n\u201cOn a day when AI stocks were down double-digit percent, Apple shares were up 3% as investors realize the potential for edge AI and there is a flight to safety driven by Apple\u2019s earnings resiliency,\u201d analysts led by Wamsi Mohan noted.\n\n\u201cIf DeepSeek is truly able to lower the cost of AI inferencing and better models are developed faster and cheaper, then edge AI applications and Apple as the edge device maker, stands to benefit. We view Apple as the ultimate play on having an LLM in your pocket,\u201d they added.\n\nBofA analysts believe several key drivers could drive upside in the tech giant\u2019s shares, such as the expected launch of the iPhone SE in March or April, insourcing of modem production to improve gross margins, the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June that may feature AI-driven use cases, and the release of the iPhone 17 in September 2025.\n\nFor IBM, BofA highlighted catalysts including a new mainframe cycle, acceleration in its Software (ETR:SOWGn) division, and mergers and acquisitions activity. Analysts project higher growth in Software for the next three years, driven by Enterprise AI opportunities and the launch of a new Mainframe (z17) in 2025.\n\n\u201cFor IBM, AI represents an opportunity in its Consulting business as it seeks to position itself as the go-to partner of choice for AI consulting.\n\nCorning's stock fell by 8.7% on Monday, but BofA analysts point out multiple key drivers that could foster recovery and growth. These include the cyclical recovery in its Optical business, the Lumen/Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) program ramps, opportunities in the Solar sector, consistent profitability in the Display segment, and its upcoming Investor Day on March 18.\n\nFor HPE, which saw its shares sink 5.8%, the firm points to the Juniper Networks (NYSE:JNPR) acquisition and cost reduction initiatives as factors that could improve margins.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u201cAI server exposure is not embedded in the valuation multiple,\u201d analysts led by Wamsi Mohan added.\n\nBofA also sees a significant value unlock for Western Digital with its anticipated spin-off, estimating value creation between $5-10 billion. The firm also references the SanDisk Analyst Day (February 11) and Western Digital Analyst Day (February 12) as key catalysts. The company\u2019s stock lost 4.5% Monday.\n\nSeagate also saw a pullback, but BofA remains bullish on the stock, citing improvements in the HDD industry structure since the last downturn.\n\nThe company's focus on ramping up Heat-Assisted Magnetic Recording (HAMR) technology, increasing gross margins through a higher mix of high-capacity/HAMR drives, and continued data center spending (excluding AI) are seen as primary growth drivers.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nBofA sees a buying opportunity in Apple, IBM shares after DeepSeek selloff\n\nMorgan Stanley cuts Nvidia stock target after DeepSeek release\n\nUS stock futures edge higher; Fed meeting, tech sector in focus\n\nView Comments",

BofA cites upcoming product launches, improvements in gross margins, and events like WWDC as catalysts for potential stock price appreciation."

        "content": "A Look Back at Consumer Electronics Stocks\u2019 Q3 Earnings: Sonos (NASDAQ:SONO) Vs The Rest Of The Pack\n\nThe end of an earnings season can be a great time to discover new stocks and assess how companies are handling the current business environment. Let\u2019s take a look at how Sonos (NASDAQ:SONO) and the rest of the consumer electronics stocks fared in Q3.\n\nConsumer electronics companies aim to address the evolving leisure and entertainment needs of consumers, who are increasingly familiar with technology in everyday life. Whether it\u2019s speakers for the home or specialized cameras to document everything from a surfing session to a wedding reception, these businesses are trying to provide innovative, high-quality products that are both useful and cool to own. Adding to the degree of difficulty for these companies is technological change, where the latest smartphone could disintermediate a whole category of consumer electronics. Companies that successfully serve customers and innovate can enjoy high customer loyalty and pricing power, while those that struggle with these may go the way of the VHS tape.\n\nThe 4 consumer electronics stocks we track reported a very strong Q3. As a group, revenues beat analysts\u2019 consensus estimates by 1.8% while next quarter\u2019s revenue guidance was 2.3% below.\n\nIn light of this news, share prices of the companies have held steady. On average, they are relatively unchanged since the latest earnings results.\n\nSonos (NASDAQ:SONO)\n\nA pioneer in connected home audio systems, Sonos (NASDAQ:SONO) offers a range of premium wireless speakers and sound systems.\n\nSonos reported revenues of $255.4 million, down 16.3% year on year. This print exceeded analysts\u2019 expectations by 2.8%. Overall, it was a strong quarter for the company with an impressive beat of analysts\u2019 EBITDA estimates.\n\n\u201cThanks to our team going all-in on our app recovery efforts, we made significant progress in bringing the quality of our software to a level that we\u2019re all proud of, which enabled us to launch our highly anticipated new products, Arc Ultra and Sub 4, in time for the holidays,\u201d Sonos CEO Patrick Spence commented.Sonos Total Revenue\n\nSonos scored the biggest analyst estimates beat but had the slowest revenue growth of the whole group. The results were likely priced in, however, and the stock is flat since reporting. It currently trades at $13.95.\n\nIs now the time to buy Sonos?

The business had an exceptional quarter with an impressive beat of analysts\u2019 EPS estimates and a solid beat of analysts\u2019 EBITDA estimates.\n\nStory Continues\n\nGoPro Total Revenue\n\nAlthough it had a fine quarter compared its peers, the market seems unhappy with the results as the stock is down 28.7% since reporting. It currently trades at $1.04.\n\nIs now the time to buy GoPro? Access our full analysis of the earnings results here, it\u2019s free.\n\nWeakest Q3: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nCreator of the iPhone and shepherd of the App Store, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a legendary developer of consumer electronics and software.\n\nApple reported revenues of $94.93 billion, up 6.1% year on year, exceeding analysts\u2019 expectations by 0.5%. It was a mixed quarter:\u00a0Despite roughly in line revenue, it was encouraging to see Apple top analysts\u2019 operating income expectations this quarter. On the other hand, the all-important Services segment missed on the revenue line.\n\nInterestingly, the stock is up 2% since the results and currently trades at $229.90.\n\nRead our full analysis of Apple\u2019s results here.\n\nPeloton (NASDAQ:PTON)\n\nStarted as a Kickstarter campaign, Peloton (NASDAQ: PTON) is a fitness technology company known for its at-home exercise equipment and interactive online workout classes.\n\nPeloton reported revenues of $585.9 million, down 1.6% year on year. This result surpassed analysts\u2019 expectations by 2.5%. It was a very strong quarter as it also produced EBITDA guidance for next quarter exceeding analysts\u2019 expectations and an impressive beat of analysts\u2019 EPS estimates.\n\nThe stock is up 23.7% since reporting and currently trades at $8.22.\n\nRead our full, actionable report on Peloton here, it\u2019s free.\n\nMarket Update\n\nThanks to the Fed's series of rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has cooled significantly from its post-pandemic highs, drawing closer to the 2% goal. This disinflation has occurred without severely impacting economic growth, suggesting the success of a soft landing. The stock market thrived in 2024, spurred by recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% each in November and December), and a notable surge followed Donald Trump's presidential election win in November, propelling indices to historic highs. Nonetheless, the outlook for 2025 remains clouded by the pace and magnitude of future rate cuts as well as potential changes in trade policy and corporate taxes once the Trump administration takes over. The path forward is marked by uncertainty.\n\nWant to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals? Check out our Top 5 Quality Compounder Stocks and add them to your watchlist.

Considering the mixed Q3 results and the existing price increase, further significant upside in the short term is less likely.

Therefore, the impact of this specific news on Apple's stock price is likely to be muted. The positive market reaction already incorporated some of the good news, and the uncertainty makes predicting further movement difficult.

        "headline": "Nasdaq futures up after sell-off; Nvidia rises after-hours - what's moving markets",
        "content": "Investing.com - Nasdaq futures inched up on Tuesday, after a steep sell-off in technology stocks in the prior session that stemmed from concerns over the impact of the success of Chinese firm DeepSeek\u2019s low-cost AI model on Big Tech spending plans. Shares in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) edged higher in extended hours trading after the AI-darling\u2019s stock price plummeted on Monday. Elsewhere, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman speaks out on DeepSeek\u2019s model, calling it \"impressive\".\n\n1. Nasdaq futures point higher after China AI model sparks steep sell-off\n\nThe Nasdaq futures contract pointed higher on Tuesday, following a day of sharp declines in the tech-heavy index after due to worries that a spike in notoriety of a cut-price Chinese artificial intelligence model could dent US AI leaders.\n\nBy 03:20 ET (08:20 GMT), the Nasdaq futures contract had risen by 55 points or 0.3%, while S&P 500 futures were mostly unchanged and Dow futures had ticked down by 96 points or 0.2%.\n\nShares in Nvidia rose in extended hours trading, clawing back some of its steep losses on Monday. The chipmaking giant and poster child of the AI boom slumped by 16.8%, erasing nearly $600 billion in stock market value -- its worst-ever drop.\n\nAn index of semiconductor stocks also slipped to its largest single-day percentage dip since March 2020, while major tech companies Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Google-owner Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) retreated as well. The Nasdaq Composite shed 3.1% and the benchmark S&P 500 lost 1.5%.\n\nThe sell-off extended beyond chipmakers and into AI-adjacent stocks such as power utilities Vistra (NYSE:VST) and Constellation Energy (NASDAQ:CEG), both of whom have been bolstered in recent months by expectations that they would see a spike in demand as companies race to power the data centers that underpin AI applications. Data center infrastructure builders fell too, with Vertiv Holdings (NYSE:VRT) decreasing by over 30%.\n\n2. Asian stocks skittish\n\nAsian stocks moved in a flat-to-low range on Tuesday, with Japanese markets leading losses as local chipmaking stocks were battered by the DeepSeek fallout.\n\nMarkets in China and South Korea were closed for the Lunar New Year holiday, with regional trading volumes expected to remain dull throughout the week because of several more regional holidays. Hong Kong markets firmed slightly ahead of an early close.\n\nBeyond DeepSeek, focus this week is also on a string of major U.S. tech earnings due in the coming days (more below). Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve is widely expected to hold interest rates steady at the conclusion of a two-day meeting on Wednesday.\n\nStory Continues\n\n3. DeepSeek sparks doubt over AI spending outlook\n\nDenting sentiment on Monday was Chinese start-up DeepSeek, which has introduced a free new chatbot it says can rival the likes of OpenAI's ChatGPT, albeit with less data and at a fraction of the cost.\n\nThe firm said it took a mere two months and under $6 million to build out its AI model on Nvidia's lower-capability H800 chips. DeepSeek's assistant run on the model became the best-selling app on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s App Store on Monday, overtaking ChatGPT in downloads.\n\nAlthough doubts still surround DeepSeek's claims, the statement fueled worries that massive spending on AI by the US tech industry's biggest names was unwarranted. U.S. President Donald Trump said DeepSeek was a \"wake-up call\" for American companies.\n\nSome analysts have flagged that DeepSeek's model could upend the long-standing hype over AI that has fueled stocks to record highs over the past year-and-a-half, but others have argued that Monday's sell-off amounted to an over-reaction.\n\n\"DeepSeek now seems to show that we can do more with existing computing power than previously thought,\" analysts at ING said in a note to clients. \"The market, therefore, needs to price in a slower adoption rate of high-performance computing and revenues of companies selling AI models.\"\n\n4. DeepSeek's model looms over tech earnings\n\nThe emergence of Hangzhou-based DeepSeek's AI model comes ahead of a raft of quarterly results from mega-cap tech companies this week.\n\nEven before DeepSeek roiled global markets, investors were keen for Silicon Valley's largest tech companies to provide more insight into their already ballooning AI budgets.\n\nMany tech industry executives have previously argued that the spending was necessary to avoid falling behind in the AI arms race, which is projected to revolutionize a variety of aspects of modern life.\n\nFour of the so-called \"Magnificent 7\" tech companies, which have been heavily responsible for recent stock market gains, are due to report this week. Meta (NASDAQ:META), software giant Microsoft and electric vehicle titan Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) are scheduled to post results on Wednesday after the closing bell on Wall Street, followed by iPhone-maker Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) on Thursday.\n\n5. OpenAI's Altman on DeepSeek\n\nSam Altman said on Monday the DeepSeek AI model, known as R1, was impressive for what it could deliver at its current cost, but that OpenAI planned to deliver better models.\n\nAltman said more computing power still remained important as OpenAI executed its research plans, and that demand for AI is likely to remain strong\n\n\u201cDeepseek's R1 is an impressive model, particularly around what they're able to deliver for the price,\u201d Altman said in a post on X. The OpenAI CEO added that the company is \u201cexcited to continue to execute on our research roadmap and believe more compute is more important now than ever before to succeed at our mission\u201d.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nNasdaq futures up after sell-off; Nvidia rises after-hours - what's moving markets\n\nUK's Foxtons 2024 earnings beat estimates on lettings business boost\n\nBOJ to raise rates again by July, eventually eye hike to 1.5%, says ex-policymaker\n\nView Comments",

However, Nasdaq futures are up, suggesting a potential rebound after the sell-off. Sam Altman's acknowledgement of DeepSeek's model as 'impressive' but stating OpenAI plans to deliver better models and that more computing power is still important, could be interpreted as a positive for the overall AI sector in the long run, potentially benefiting AAPL. The upcoming earnings report will be crucial. Given the mixed signals, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a stock price fall due to the immediate concerns about AI spending and DeepSeek's impact, but the potential for a rebound and positive earnings results keeps the probability of a rise significant."

The news focuses on the impact on AI infrastructure companies and chipmakers like Nvidia.  Apple's App Store briefly saw DeepSeek's app as a top download, but this is not necessarily a negative indicator for Apple's long-term prospects.  The overall market reaction is negative, but the impact on Apple is likely to be less severe than on companies directly involved in the AI hardware and software race.  The upcoming earnings report will be crucial, and the market's reaction to it will heavily influence Apple's stock price.  Given the overall negative sentiment in the tech sector and the uncertainty surrounding the long-term implications of DeepSeek's model, the probability of a price fall is slightly higher than a price rise in the short term, but the impact is likely to be less dramatic than for companies more directly involved in the AI hardware and software market."

Given that Nvidia's stock rose in after-hours trading, it indicates a potential recovery from the steep losses incurred. For Apple, despite the short-term market reaction, its strong ecosystem and leading position in AI applications through its devices like the iPhone and MacBook could mitigate any negative impacts.

The market's reaction will depend on the credibility and influence of the dissenting voice, which is not specified in the provided information. Given the mixed signals, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a rise, but not overwhelmingly so."

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 35 Most Important AI Stocks for 2025 According to JPMorgan.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nInvestors have become increasingly concerned about the rising capital expenditures on artificial intelligence, with many wondering whether the expectations embedded in financial markets today project a realistic path ahead. According to a recent report on the topic by investment bank JPMorgan,\u00a0 investors should focus on opportunities that will prevail right along the AI value chain. Analysts at the bank have advised investors to weigh future potential earnings against what is already embedded in the price. Per JPMorgan, cheaper valuations and less demanding earnings expectations outside of mega-cap tech stocks suggest that even AI bulls should be positioned for further broadening across sectors in 2025.\n\nThe Investment Outlook 2025 report by JPMorgan takes a look at the soaring valuations of the Magnificent Seven group of stocks and their importance to the AI revolution. The bank highlights that while each of the companies in the Magnificent Seven are geared differently to the AI theme, this group of stocks now makes up nearly 35% of the S&P 500 market cap and has driven over 70% of returns since the beginning of 2023. This performance, compared against the rest of the market, has allowed for the expansion of valuations. JPMorgan underlines that while the rest of the S&P 500 trades on a 12-month forward earnings multiple of 19x, the largest 10 stocks in the index now trade on 29x.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nAnalysts led by Karen Ward, the Chief Market Strategist for EMEA at JPMorgan, contend that the valuation discrepancy between tech and the rest is unsustainable. The report stresses that if the broad AI ecosystem generates sufficient revenues to justify the earnings expectations already assumed for a handful of companies, the rest should catch up over time. It also cautions that if instead, the broader corporate universe does not see the clear use case of these technologies and is unwilling to pay for them, then a catch down scenario is more likely. However, when the strong fundamentals of these mega caps are compared to other parts of the S&P 500 today, as well as to the 2000s tech bubble, a catch down seems unlikely, it notes.\n\nJPMorgan broke down the AI revolution into five key areas. These were identified as AI hardware, AI hyperscalers, AI developers, AI integrators, and AI essentials. Hardware firms were defined as the companies that drive the design and manufacture of the semiconductors that are key to generating computing power. Hyperscalers were picked out as the companies that provide physical AI infrastructure such as cloud services and data centers, create custom silicon chips, and build large language models that can be used by other companies. AI developers were recognized as software companies that leverage hyperscaler technologies to provide solutions for end users.\n\nStory Continues\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nAI integrators were pinned down as the larger organizations that have sufficient technology functionality to build their own AI solutions, as well as the IT services companies that support them. AI essentials were singled out as companies that are less directly impacted by the technology itself, but provide the resources that enable the whole AI value chain to work, whether that is energy, air conditioning, raw materials or even the data to train models. JPMorgan has warned that there is a substantial gap between the revenue expectations of hardware companies and the revenue growth that can be generated by the AI ecosystem. The bank has cautioned that this weakness can spread throughout the AI value chain.\n\nThe report notes that the attention of investors has so far focused on AI hardware and AI hyperscalers, two areas of the AI industry more exposed to the technology and communication services sectors. Per JPMorgan, high levels of valuation dispersion in these categories suggest that opportunities for skilled stock pickers persist, but investors must recognize that any earnings disappointment could lead to substantial volatility. The report further highlights that these categories are also likely to be the most exposed to escalating trade tensions between the US and China. The bank predicts ample opportunities for investors in the AI essentials and AI developers bucket over time.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through a note on the AI industry by investment bank JPMorgan. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Apple Inc. (AAPL): Jim Cramer Explains Why It\u2019s the \u2018Quarterback of Your Portfolio\u2019 - Here\u2019s Why\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. Core AI applications that the tech giant is heavily invested in include Siri, Apple's voice assistant, and features like on-device machine learning for predictive text, photo categorization, and personalized recommendations across devices. These AI-driven innovations contribute to user retention within Apple\u2019s ecosystem, driving demand for hardware like iPhones, Macs, and wearables, as well as services such as iCloud and Apple Music. In recent years, Apple has ramped up investments in AI, including acquiring AI startups and developing proprietary AI chips like the Neural Engine, which powers real-time processing for AI tasks. Rumors of generative AI projects and expanded use of AI in health monitoring and augmented reality have further positioned Apple as a key player in the AI landscape.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 6th on our list of the important AI stocks for 2025 according to JP Morgan. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other top AI news you shouldn\u2019t miss.\n\nAll everyone could talk about in the technical AI landscape these days is DeepSeek-R1, a Chinese open-source LLM that analysts believe can give major American AI companies a run for their money. Why is DeepSeek making waves and why is it called a breakthrough in the AI race?\n\nDeepSeek AI model is several times cheaper to use for professional purposes when compared to its American counterparts including OpenAI\u2019s o1 model. Media reports also suggest the model beat almost all key AI models in the industry by significant margins.\n\nCNBC\u2019s Deirdre Bosa explained what makes these Chinese models a challenge for US tech companies:\n\n\u201cThe cost, I mean, these models coming out of China are just built at a fraction of the price when you think about OpenAI. That\u2019s spending $5 billion a year, burning through billions of dollars a year. These models, the DeepSeek for example, they say they built it for less than $6 million. ByteDance as well, you know, shows that it was built and you can access it at much, much lower prices. So, this really turns on sort of this truth that we have thought about generative AI for the last few years\u2014that you need hundreds of millions of dollars to develop bigger and better models. What the Chinese labs and companies are doing is they\u2019re going straight to the frontier. They\u2019re building with sort of infrastructure and outputs that are already out there, built in many cases by American companies and startups, and they\u2019re improving on it, they\u2019re innovating on it, and producing models that are just as good, in some cases, at a fraction of the cost.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In\n\nFor this article, we picked 10 AI stocks currently in the news. With each company we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Analyst on Apple (AAPL): \u2018I Don\u2019t Think AI is a Story Yet\u2019\n\nguteksk7/Shutterstock.com\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 158\n\nBonawyn Eison, Chief Investment Officer and Managing Partner, Wynsource Partners, recently said on CNBC that he does not believe AI would be a strong enough driver for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) to take the company to the next level.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t understand what the real drivers of the super cycle are, and if AI is the catalyst behind it, I can understand that. They don\u2019t have the same cashback spend as some of the other MAGs, so there\u2019s a floor there. But in terms of what\u2019s going to take what is already a fully valued company to the next level and lead to, either for me, P/E expansion, I don\u2019t think AI is a story yet, or I don\u2019t see it.\u201d\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is desperately in need of new catalysts. The company\u2019s revenue in China fell 8% in fiscal year 2024, following a 2% decline the previous year. The Chinese market accounts for about 15% of Apple\u2019s total revenue, so this downtrend cannot be ignored.\n\nInvestors had hopes from the Wearables, Home, and Accessories segment, but so far its performance has been weak. Vision Pro faces tough competition from Meta\u2019s $500 Quest and the more affordable Quest 3S, making it hard to justify its $3,500 price tag. The failure of Apple\u2019s HomePod, unable to compete with Amazon\u2019s and Google\u2019s lower-priced offerings, further highlights the challenges in this market.\n\nApple\u2019s iPhone 16 has not shown promising growth prospects yet and investors are still in a wait-and-see mode on the AI platform.\n\nCDT Capital Management stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cThe crowd. While this evolution in AI is going to change the world, market expectations for the technology have become unhinged. The crowd, which is more like an exuberant mob, anointed the Mag 7 with spectacular, nonsensical valuations based on the premise that AI will be an amazing, money-printing growth engine for these companies \u2013 and the truth is it likely will be. The problem is that the math just isn\u2019t mathing.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of top AI news you shouldn\u2019t miss. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

        "content": "Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) just flipped the script on a brutal AI sell-off, while Apple jumps more than 3.7% and Meta climbs 0.6% today's early afternoon, while the rest of Big Tech took a beating. The trigger? Chinese AI upstart DeepSeek unveiled a shockingly cost-effective AI model, sending ripples through the industry. Apple investors took it as a winsmaller, more efficient AI models mean better on-device AI for iPhones. Meanwhile, Meta's Mark Zuckerberg isn't backing down, signaling up to $65 billion in AI investments this year as the company races to build out its Llama model.\n\nAdding fuel to Apple's rally, JPMorgan raised its iPhone build estimates for 1H25, citing better-than-expected demand out of China. The firm now expects Apple to churn out 48 million iPhones in Q1 2025, an 8% jump from previous forecasts, thanks to stronger orders for the upcoming iPhone SE4. Still, Apple's stock is 12% off its recent highs, weighed down by iPhone sales concerns and fresh downgrades from Jefferies and Loop Capital. All eyes are now on Apple's January 30 earnings report, where analysts are betting on a $126 billion quarterjust ahead of consensus.\n\nBut the real shocker? DeepSeek just rewrote the AI investment playbook. Its latest model reportedly cost just $5.6 million to trainpeanuts compared to OpenAI's $100 million bill for GPT-4. That's spooking investors in AI infrastructure-heavy plays like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), all of which tumbled as fears of AI cost deflation spread.

However, the article also mentions that Apple's stock is 12% off its recent highs due to iPhone sales concerns and downgrades from Jefferies and Loop Capital. The upcoming earnings report on January 30 is a key event that could significantly impact the stock price. The DeepSeek news, while potentially positive for Apple in the long run, introduces uncertainty about the overall AI landscape. Considering these factors, the positive catalysts seem to outweigh the negative ones in the short term, but the existing concerns and upcoming earnings introduce some risk.

The upcoming earnings report will be crucial in determining investor sentiment.

However, concerns remain, including iPhone sales worries and recent downgrades by Jefferies and Loop Capital, which could temper gains. The upcoming earnings report on January 30 will be a critical catalyst. Overall, the positive factors appear to outweigh the negatives in the short term."

                "reasoning": "The news article highlights a mixed impact on Apple Inc. (AAPL) due to recent developments in the AI sector. On one hand, Apple's stock price surged by more than 3.7% following the unveiling of a cost-effective AI model by Chinese AI upstart DeepSeek, which investors perceive as beneficial for Apple's on-device AI capabilities for iPhones. Additionally, JPMorgan raised its iPhone build estimates for 1H25, citing better-than-expected demand, particularly for the upcoming iPhone SE4. On the other hand, Apple's stock is 12% off its recent highs due to iPhone sales concerns and downgrades from Jefferies and Loop Capital. The overall sentiment seems cautiously optimistic, with potential for both upward and downward movement depending on the earnings report and market interpretation of AI cost dynamics."

Additionally, Meta's significant investment in AI and JPMorgan's raised iPhone build estimates are contributing to the positive sentiment. However, the article also mentions that Apple's stock is 12% off its recent highs due to iPhone sales concerns and downgrades from Jefferies and Loop Capital. Considering these factors, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling, but still cautious due to the existing concerns."

        "content": "China\u2019s Deepseek AI chatbot has triggered a sell-off in major tech stocks - Lam Yik/Bloomberg\n\nUS stock markets have plunged at their sharpest pace in five months after a China AI start-up unveiled a new chatbot which threatens to match its major global competitors at a lower cost.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index on Wall Street plummeted by 3.6pc at the opening bell - its biggest fall since September - as DeepSeek\u2019s new artificial intelligence chatbot triggered market turmoil.\n\nAI-focused shares in the US and Europe were at one point on track for $1 trillion to be wiped off their valuation, according to Bloomberg, after the China app soared to the top of the Apple Store\u2019s download charts.\n\nDeepSeek stunned industry insiders with its ability to match its US competitors and said it had spent only $5.6m (\u00a34.5m) developing its model.\n\nBy contrast, Microsoft has already ploughed $14bn into ChatGPT maker OpenAI. Its shares dropped 3.5pc in New York, knocking more than $119bn (\u00a395bn) off its valuation.\n\nWilliam Beavington of Jefferies said: \u201cWhat\u2019s particularly remarkable to us really is the cost effectiveness and the efficiency they have driven from the chips being used.\u201d\n\nChip making giant Nvidia was down 13pc, wiping nearly $465bn (\u00a3371bn) off the value of the world\u2019s dominant supplier of AI hardware and software. It had already closed down more than 3pc on Wall Street on Friday.\n\nJapanese tech conglomerate SoftBank was down more than 8pc overnight, less than a week after it was announced as a key investor in US President Donald Trump\u2019s new $500bn (\u00a3401bn) venture to build infrastructure for artificial intelligence in the United States.\n\nDeepSeek was developed by a start-up based in the eastern Chinese city of Hangzhou, known for its high density of tech firms.\n\nAvailable as an app or on desktop, it can do many of the things that its Western competitors can do - write song lyrics, help work on a personal development plan, or even write a recipe for dinner based on what\u2019s in the fridge.\n\nVenture capitalist Marc Andreessen, a close advisor to Trump, described it as \u201cAI\u2019s Sputnik moment\u201d - a reference to the Soviet satellite launch that sparked the Cold War space race.\n\nScale AI\u2019s Alexandr Wang wrote on X that DeepSeek \u201cis a wake up call for America\u201d.\n\nRead the latest updates below.\n\n06:15 PM GMT\n\nSigning off...\n\nThanks for joining us today on this live blog covering DeepSeek and the Wall Street tech sell-off.\n\nCurrently, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index is down 3.4pc. Nvidia is down 16.6pc.\n\nMeanwhile, the S&P 500 is down 1.9pc and Dow Jones Industrial Average, of 30 leading US companies, has regained its earlier losses. It is currently up 0.1pc.\n\nStory Continues\n\n05:55 PM GMT\n\nReaders discuss what DeepSeek means to Western tech giants\n\nTelegraph subscribers have been weighing in on the implications of DeepSeek. You can carry on the conversation in the comments.\n\n05:51 PM GMT\n\nDeepSeek a \u2018double-edged sword\u2019 for tech giants, says economist\n\nUS tech giants face a \u201cdouble-edged sword\u201d from DeepSeek, and could benefit from it, an economist has said.\n\nJohn Higgins, chief markets economist at Capital Economics, said that the so-called \u201chyperscalers\u201d, the tech giants operating data centres that offer cloud computing, \u201cdon\u2019t seem to be in a rush to scale back investment in AI\u201d.\n\nHe said: \u201cMeanwhile, Stargate [a $500bn (\u00a3400bn) investment in artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure] suggests a general push in the opposite direction, ie, the need for more, not less, investment in the technology in the US.\n\n\u201cNonetheless, if it became clear that AI models could indeed be trained effectively with less high-end computing power than had previously been assumed, there would clearly be a risk of a further correction in the US stock market. That\u2019s because this would potentially undermine the dominant positions of some firms that have powered the rally.\n\n\u201cHaving said that, while such an outcome would conceivably be detrimental for the semiconductor industry, it would potentially be a double-edged sword for some hyperscalers (insofar as it lowered their capital costs, but undermined their dominance in the marketplace). And it would presumably be beneficial for users and consumers of cheaper and easier-to-access AI models.\u201d\n\n05:32 PM GMT\n\nUS sell-off hits European tech firms\n\nThe sell-off of tech firms in the US also spread to continental Europe. In the Netherlands, chip equipment giant ASML dropped 7pc to touch a two-month low and ASM International slumping more than 12pc.\n\nTwo Germany business that provide electric hardware for AI infrastructure tanked. Siemens Energy plunged 19.9pc, while Schneider Electric fell 9.6pc. They were among the weakest performers on the pan-European Stoxx 600 index.\n\nThe sell-off comes after the Stoxx 600 touched an intra-day record high on Friday and as investors await earnings from U.S. tech giants Apple, Meta, Microsoft and Tesla later this week.\n\n05:22 PM GMT\n\nDeepSeek won\u2019t destroy demand for AI chips, says investment manager\n\nChipmakers have taken a pounding today on the back of reports that China\u2019s DeepSeek can deliver good AI without lots of hardware.\n\nChipmaker Nvidia is down 15.7pc. The tech titan is known as the leader in GPUs, the advanced semiconductors needed to run AI applications.\n\nMeanwhile ARM has lost 10pc and AMD is down 5.8pc. Intel dropped 2.9pc.\n\nJay Hatfield, chief executive of Infrastructure Capital Advisors, said: \u201cIt\u2019s clearly not good for ChatGPT to have an aggressive competitor, but we don\u2019t buy the thesis that this is going to tank the demand for high-end GPUs.\u201d\n\n05:17 PM GMT\n\nDeepSeek will unleash Chinese innovation, says tech analyst\n\nBen Thompson, whose Stratechery newsletter is widely read by tech industry leaders, said today that China is \u201ca big winner, in ways that I suspect will only become apparent over time.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cNot only does the country have access to DeepSeek, but I suspect that DeepSeek\u2019s relative success to America\u2019s leading AI labs will result in a further unleashing of Chinese innovation as they realise they can compete\u201d.\n\nHe also said that consumers could get a big win here, since the AI is \u201copen sourced\u201d.\n\n\u201cDeepSeek has provided a massive gift to nearly everyone. The biggest winners are consumers and businesses who can anticipate a future of effectively-free AI products and services,\u201d he said.\n\n04:54 PM GMT\n\nInvestors make flight to safety after Nvidia jitters\n\nThe tumble in global stocks has prompted a flight to safety, with US government bonds rising and safe-haven currencies surging.\n\nDeepSeek, which overtook rival ChatGPT to become the top-rated free application on Apple\u2019s App Store in the UK and US, says it uses lower-cost chips. This challenges a widespread bet in markets that AI will drive huge expenditure with chipmakers.\n\nOn Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.1pc, the S&P 500 dropped 1.8pc, and the Nasdaq Composite slumped 3pc.\n\nNvidia, whose chips are the top choice for powering AI applications, dropped 15.5pc in line with industry peers Broadcom and Marvell Technology. The CBOE Volatility Index, known as Wall Street\u2019s \u201cfear gauge\u201d, hit its highest level since Dec 20, surging 25pc today.\n\nRobert Savage, head of markets strategy and insights at BNY, said: \u201cThe catalyst of a foreign competitor to US-led AI dominance begs other questions about trade and semiconductor chips and energy needs. The markets are unsettled, and volatility is higher after last week\u2019s strong returns.\u201d\n\nIn Europe, the pan-European Stoxx 600 index was little changed, but the Stoxx Europe 600 technology index fell 3pc, its biggest one-day drop since mid-October. MSCI\u2019s gauge of stocks across the globe fell 1.25pc, while the FTSE 100 was flat.\n\nUS Treasury yields tumbled to multi-week lows today, tracking steep declines in equities, as investors sought the safety of government bonds. The benchmark US 10-year yield dropped 4.546pc from 4.594pc late on Friday.\n\nThat pushed the dollar lower, with safe-haven currencies, including the \u00a0the yen and Swiss franc, as the main beneficiaries.Some investors have switched from stocks to bonds - Angela Weiss/AFP via Getty Images\n\n04:33 PM GMT\n\nDeepSeek struggles under \u2018malicious attacks\u2019\n\nChinese startup DeepSeek is struggling to keep up with demand from new users this afternoon.\n\nIts website says: \u201cDue to large-scale malicious attacks on DeepSeek\u2019s services, registration may be busy. Please wait and try again. Registered users can log in normally. Thank you for your understanding and support.\u201d\n\nEarlier it was hit by outages on its website. Its status page said the company had resolved issues relating to its application programming interface and users\u2019 inability to log in to the website.\n\nThe outages on Monday coincided with its sky-rocketing popularity.Deepseek said it had been hit by \u2018large-scale malicious attacks\u2019 - Andrey Rudakov/Bloomberg\n\n04:27 PM GMT\n\nChinese breakthrough gives hope to Europe, claims academic\n\nEurope\u2019s tech startups should be encouraged by the success of DeepSeek, a Barcelona-based business school professor has said.\n\nSampsa Samila, director of an AI programme at IESE Business School, said: \u201cDeepSeek has reset expectations on the capital intensity of large language models and shows that the market is in fact rather competitive and not simply dominated by a small number of very large companies.\n\n\u201cIt also demonstrates that better thinking can beat vast amounts of money, which should give hope to AI startups in Europe, where we have plenty of human capital but do not have the tens of billions to invest in training LLMs that we see in the US.\u201d\n\n04:24 PM GMT\n\nUS stock markets starting to change behaviour, says abrdn\n\nInvestors in US stocks are starting to focus more closely on profit growth rather than valuations, a leading investment manager has said.\n\nJamie Mills O\u2019Brien, investment director at abrdn, said: \u201cJitters in the tech market reinforce our view that investors should not be confining themselves only to the so-called Manificent Seven when looking for growth...\n\n\u201cWe are also starting to see signs of a market behaving slightly differently, with earnings growth - rather than [price to earnings] multiple expansion - becoming a more important arbiter of equity returns.\n\n\u201cHistorically when you hit the peak of a hiking cycle, market focus turns to earnings growth. And that is what we are seeing again \u2013 earnings, not multiples, are driving relative performance in 2024 than they have done over the last couple of years.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cEmerging markets and China are set to deliver earnings growth over and above the US market. We think that might be significant, in particular given the valuation discrepancy we are seeing.\u201d\n\n04:15 PM GMT\n\nChinese AI could boost US tech giants, says analyst\n\nWhile Nvidia has plunged today, two of the Magnificent 7 tech stocks have actually risen.\n\nKathleen Brooks, research director at XTB, said: \u201cToday\u2019s sell off could be an overreaction. If AI can run on less advanced chips, then it opens the door to stronger growth over a shorter time frame.\n\n\u201cThis may be bad news for AI\u2019s hardware producers like Nvidia, but surely it is good news for the hyper-scalers, like Microsoft, Meta and the cloud companies? This is reflected in the performance of the Magnificent 7 at the start of this week.\u201d\n\nNvidia dropped 13.6pc, Amazon is down 1pc, Microsoft is down 3.5pc, Alphabet dropped 2.5pc, Tesla lost 1pc, Apple rose 2.6pc, Meta rose 2pc.\n\n04:10 PM GMT\n\nDeepSeek surges to top of Apple\u2019s App Store\n\nChinese AI app DeepSeek is now leading the list of most popular downloads on the iPhone\u2019s App store in the UK and the US.\n\nAmerican rival ChatGPT is currently in second place.\n\nBloomberg reported that computer scientist Kai-Fu Lee told the Asian Financial Forum in Hong Kong this month: \u201cThe US is great at research and innovation and especially breakthrough, but China is better at engineering. In this day and age, when you have limited compute power and money, you learn how to build things very efficiently.\u201dDeepSeek has shot to top of the App Store and given Wall Street a fright - Yuki Iwamura/Bloomberg\n\n03:44 PM GMT\n\nSell-off is \u2018overblown\u2019, says analyst\n\nDan Ives, a Wall Street analyst at Wedbush Securities, insists the sell-off is overblown.\n\nHe said: \u201cNo US Global 2000 [company] is going to use a Chinese start-up DeepSeek to launch their AI infrastructure and use cases.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day there is only one chip company in the world launching autonomous, robotics, and broader AI use cases and that is Nvidia.\n\n\u201cLaunching a competitive LLM model for consumer use cases is one thing ... launching broader AI infrastructure is a whole other ballgame and nothing with DeepSeek makes us believe anything different.\u201d\n\n03:40 PM GMT\n\nNothing lasts forever - is this AI\u2019s Amstrad moment?\n\nMost tech investors will be nursing their losses today. James Baxter-Derrington writes:\n\nWhile DeepSeek has disrupted what\u2019s already happening in the space, it remains to be seen if it can lead.\n\nRead on as James asks: is now the time to buy up cheap tech firms?Amstrad was once a major computer brand - Phil Coburn\n\n03:31 PM GMT\n\nAI \u2018game has changed\u2019 after DeepSeek launch, says academic\n\nProf Michael Woolridge, an AI expert at Oxford University, said DeepSeek\u2019s model challenges the notion that big US AI companies had a \u201cmoat\u201d which would be hard for other companies to crack.\n\nHe said: \u201cDeepSeek challenges that wisdom, being just as capable as the flagship US models, at a fraction of the scale.\n\n\u201cIf the claims are proved to hold up in the weeks ahead, then this will shape up to be a major challenge to the big players.\n\n\u201cAnd as a side effect, it will also make this technology massively more available than it was previously \u2013 admitting a whole range of new actors into the space (which will worry governments, who are already worried about the power that AI puts in the hands of unscrupulous actors).\n\n\u201cAnd it rather starkly demonstrates that China is very much keeping pace with the US in large-scale AI. I would want to see more evidence to support the claims, but if they do hold up, then the game just changed: scale isn\u2019t everything after all.\u201d\n\nThanks for following today\u2019s updates so far. My colleague Alex Singleton is stepping up now to keep you informed on what\u2019s happening with the AI tech sell-off.\n\n03:18 PM GMT\n\nChinese AI has sparked a $1 trillion panic \u2013 and it doesn\u2019t care about free speech\n\nHave there been human rights abuses in Xinjiang? Ask ChatGPT, the artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot, and you\u2019ll receive an unambiguous yes.\n\nPut the same question to DeepSeek, a Chinese chatbot, and the answer is very different. \u201cAllegations of human rights abuses are unfounded and politically motivated,\u201d it says.\n\nIts response is not unusual: chatbots are heavily muzzled in China, where AI companies are required to instill the \u201csocialist values\u201d of the Communist Party and are regularly tested by Beijing\u2019s censors.\n\nRead how DeepSeek is sending shockwaves through Wall Street \u2013 and the West.DeepSeek\u2019s answers to various questions about China and its policies\n\n03:09 PM GMT\n\nNvidia suffers biggest rout in stock market history over China AI threat\n\nNvidia has suffered the largest stock market rout in history at the opening bell on Wall Street.\n\nThe world\u2019s most valuable company plunged 13pc as trading began in New York today, wiping more than $465bn (\u00a3371bn) off its valuation.\n\nIt still leaves the AI chip maker\u2019s market capitalisation at $3.1 trillion (\u00a32.5 trillion) as doubts emerge about US dominance of the nascent industry.\n\nThe fall in its value today eclipsed the previous record, a 9pc drop in September that wiped out about $279bn in value, according to Bloomberg.\n\n02:47 PM GMT\n\nMicrosoft suffers $119bn blow amid China AI fears\n\nStocks linked to the boom in AI have suffered steep losses at the start of trading on Wall Street over concerns that China will disrupt America\u2019s grip on the burgeoning industry.\n\nMicrosoft, which has invested close to $14bn into ChatGPT maker OpenAI, has fallen 3.5pc, knocking more than $119bn (\u00a395bn) off its valuation.\n\nChip maker Advanced Micro Devices was down 4.8pc while Micron was down 8.9pc.\n\nDell fell 7pc and Super Micro Computer dropped 8.8pc.More than $119bn has been wiped off the value of Microsoft, led by Satya Nadella - Mark Kauzlarich/Bloomberg\n\n02:38 PM GMT\n\nUS stocks plunge over China\u2019s AI threat\n\nUS stock markets have plunged at their sharpest pace in five months after a China AI start-up unveiled a new chatbot which threatens to match its major global competitors at a lower cost.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index on Wall Street plummeted by 3.6pc at the opening bell\u00a0to 19,234.042 - its biggest fall since September - as DeepSeek\u2019s new artificial intelligence chatbot triggered market turmoil.\n\nAI-focused shares in the US and Europe have suffered a $1 trillion (\u00a3799bn) rout after the China app soared to the top of the Apple Store\u2019s download charts.\n\nChip making giant Nvidia was down 13pc, wiping nearly $465bn (\u00a3371bn) off the value of the world\u2019s dominant supplier of AI hardware and software. It had already closed down more than 3pc on Wall Street on Friday.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 275.4 points, or 0.6pc, at the open to 44,148.84.

Otherwise, the rally has been impressively resilient against the higher long-term borrowing costs of recent weeks.\n\n\u201cAnd economic growth itself remains robust, with no sign yet of the negative data surprises that preceded the turmoil last summer.\u201d\n\n01:06 PM GMT\n\nUK stocks shielded from tech sell-off\n\nThe FTSE 100 has been insulated from the rapid sell-off in tech stocks after it hit a record high at the end of last week.\n\nBritain\u2019s flagship index was down 0.2pc to its lowest in a week but the losses were miniscule compared to the 3.9pc drop that the Nasdaq is on track to make at the opening bell.\n\nThe midcap FTSE 250 was down 0.6pc as it was dragged lower by its technology stocks, which have been hit by the rising popularity of Chinese AI app DeepSeek, which has raised questions about lofty valuations of tech giants on Wall Street.\n\nSusannah Streeter of Hargreaves Lansdown added: \u201cThe make up of the FTSE 100 also offers resilience in an uncertain world, with pharma, consumer staples, and utility stocks offering the prospect of stable returns whatever the economic weather.\u201d\n\n12:40 PM GMT\n\nWall Street fear gauge rises amid tech sell-off\n\nWall Street\u2019s so-called \u201cfear gauge\u201d has moved higher amid a sharp sell-off in tech stocks.\n\nThe Cboe Volatility Index has hit its highest level so far this year, has risen more than six points to 21.38.\n\nDavid Morrison of Trade Nation said: \u201cInvestors have been forced to reconsider the outlook for capital expenditure and valuations given the threat of discount Chinese AI models.\n\n\u201cThese appear to be as good, if not better, than US versions.\u201d\n\n12:10 PM GMT\n\nTech sell-off eases government borrowing costs\n\nTreasury borrowing costs have fallen to their lowest level since the turn of the year as the sharp sell-off in tech stocks pushed investors towards safe haven assets.\n\nThe yield on 10-year UK gilts - a benchmark of government borrowing costs - has fall seven basis points today to 4.56pc as money moved out of tech companies and into the relative stability of sovereign-backed bonds.\n\nGovernment bonds are considered a safe haven because the returns - the yield - are guaranteed by the state. The yield falls when there is greater demand as the government does not need to promise higher returns to attract buyers for its debt.\n\nThe fall in borrowing costs has wiped out the spike in yields earlier this month which triggered doubts about Rachel Reeves\u2019s ability to meet her fiscal rules. It had threatened to wipe out her \u00a310bn of fiscal headroom, which had been described by economists as \u201crazor thin\u201d.\n\nThe yield on 10-year US Treasury bonds plunged by 11 basis points to 4.5pc, its lowest level this year.\n\nDeutsche Bank analyst Jim Reid said the drop in borrowing costs \u201cshows how crucial a handful of US stocks are to global macro\u201d.\n\nPointing to the 14pc plunge in Nvidia shares, he said: \u201cThis is a company that has gone from relative earnings obscurity to one of the most profitable in the world inside two years and the largest company in the world as of Friday night.\n\n\u201cThe problem is that the AI industry is embryonic. And it\u2019s almost impossible to know how it will develop or what competition current winners might face even if you fully believe in its potential to drive future productivity.\n\n\u201cThe stratospheric rise of DeepSeek reminds us of this.\u201dChancellor Rachel Reeves has come under pressure this year after a surge in government bond yields wiped out her fiscal headroom left in the Budget - REUTERS/Yves Herman\n\n11:47 AM GMT\n\nNvidia down 12pc in premarket trading\n\nIt is becoming harder to keep track of how fast investors are dumping risky assets linked to the boom in artificial intelligence today.\n\nNvidia, the chip maker that has become the darling of the sector, has plunged 12pc in premarket trading.\n\nOther chipmakers such as AMD and Micron Technology fell 5.3pc and 8.4pc, respectively.\n\nMicrosoft, which has backed ChatGPT maker OpenAI, is down 5.9pc\n\nAI server makers Dell Technologies and Super Micro Computer slid 9.3pc and 10.9pc ahead of the opening bell in New York.Nvidia co-founder and chief executive Jensen Huang is preparing for about $400bn to be wiped off the value of his company - An Rong Xu/Bloomberg\n\n11:34 AM GMT\n\nDeepSeek pours cold water on AI \u2018scaling laws\u2019\n\nThe artificial intelligence market boom of the last two years has been built on the idea that building increasingly advanced systems will require companies such as OpenAI, Microsoft and Google to spend unprecedented sums on computer hardware such as Nvidia microchips and huge data centres.\n\n\u201cScaling laws\u201d - the idea that smarter AI will require more data and more spending - have become gospel in Silicon Valley.\n\nIt had made Nvidia the world\u2019s most valuable company and created a halo effect around companies such as ASML, whose machines make the microchips.\n\nThe arrival of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI start-up, has appeared to pour cold water on that theory.\n\nThe company claims that it cost just $5.6m to train its latest V3 model, which offers similar performance to the best OpenAI and Google AI systems.\n\nA new model released last week, R1, claims to contain so-called \u201creasoning\u201d capabilities which experts see as a step towards human-level AI.\n\nIf the techniques DeepSeek used to develop its models spread into the rest of the AI world, it could lead to a sharp slowdown in spending on Nvidia chips and other hardware, which have been the picks and shovels of the current AI gold rush.\n\nAs Mizuho\u2019s Jordan Rochester put it on Monday:\u00a0\u201cIt fundamentally breaks the AI Capex narrative if true.\u201d\n\n11:14 AM GMT\n\nTech rout deepens on Wall Street\n\nThe Nasdaq has plummeted further ahead of the opening bell on Wall Street as the DeepSeek tech rout deepens.\n\nThe tech-focused index was down more than 5pc in premarket trading, while S&P 500 \u201cfutures\u201d contracts were down 3pc.\n\nBen Barringer, technology analyst at Quilter Cheviot, said: \u201cDeepSeek\u2019s success will serve to intensify the US/China AI war, particularly following the recent announcement of the Stargate project in the US.\n\n\u201cIt also provides a wake up call and somewhat of a question mark on how much needs to be spent in order to build a model, and whether quite the level of CapEx we have been seeing is really required.\n\n\u201cHowever, bringing the price of model training down is no bad thing as it will help to lower the entry point and this price elasticity could help drive usage and volume.\u201d\n\n11:04 AM GMT\n\nTrue value of AI lies in data, says Salesforce boss\n\nChina chatbot DeepSeek is proving that the true value of AI is not in the user experience but in the data used to enhance it, the boss of US cloud software company Salesforce has said.\n\nDeepSeek said it had taken just two months and less than $6m (\u00a34.8m) to build a model more advanced than many of its Western competitors.\n\n10:43 AM GMT\n\nTech stocks on track for $1 trillion wipe-out\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s new artificial intelligence chatbot has triggered market turmoil that could wipe more than $1 trillion (\u00a3799bn) off technology companies at the opening bell in New York later.\n\nThe Nasdaq 100 has tumbled 3.4pc in premarket trading, while contracts on the S&P 500 fell 2pc.\n\nIn Europe, tech stocks led market losses, with shares of chip equipment maker ASML down 11pc.\n\nThe Nasdaq 100 and Europe\u2019s Stoxx 600 technology companies are together on track to take a hit of more than $1 trillion to their market valuations if the losses are confirmed at the opening bell on Wall Street this afternoon.\n\n10:34 AM GMT\n\nChina\u2019s lightning AI success should frighten Wall Street \u2013 and Trump\n\nChina has astonished the artificial intelligence community with a new model that runs at the fraction of the cost of American \u201cfrontier\u201d models, writes Andrew Orlowski.\n\nDeepSeek is almost as good too and it has published the source code, so everyone can download it and run it.

While some analysts suggest the sell-off is an overreaction and that cheaper AI could benefit cloud companies in the long run, the immediate impact is overwhelmingly negative for companies like Apple, which are indirectly affected by the broader market downturn and investor sentiment. Apple's relatively small drop compared to others might be due to its diversified business model, but the overall negative market sentiment and uncertainty surrounding the AI landscape significantly outweigh any potential positive effects for Apple in the short term. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is significantly higher than a rise."

        "content": "TikTok Ban Sparks Frenzy: iPhones With The App Installed Sell For $14K On eBay, Some Listed In The Millions\n\nThe recent TikTok ban in the U.S. caused millions of people a lot of confusion and frustration. Over the weekend, TikTok was removed from Apple's App Store and Google Play because of a nationwide ban. If someone deleted the app, they couldn't download it again. This has created a booming market for iPhones with TikTok still installed, with some devices selling for thousands of dollars and others listed for millions.\n\nPhones Selling for Thousands\u2014Or More\n\niPhones with TikTok pre-installed have turned into highly sought-after items on eBay. Some sellers are asking for smaller amounts, like $200-$500, but others are asking for way more. One iPhone reportedly sold for $14,000, and another was listed for a shocking $4.9 million. In Raleigh, North Carolina, a seller posted an iPhone with TikTok for over $1 million, saying the only issue was a small scratch on the screen protector.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nThe Biggest Disruption To IP Since Disney \u2014 Get in now as they monetize a $2 Trillion market by building content around the most profitable Character IP in history and combining it with the Patented Technology IP of the future. Deloitte's fastest-growing software company partners with Amazon, Walmart & Target \u2013 Many are rushing to grab 4,000 of its pre-IPO shares for just $0.26/share!\n\nUSA Today reports that in Florida, another seller listed an iPhone 15 Pro Max \"With TikTok\" for $10,000, and over 1,800 people viewed the listing in just one day. A seller in the U.K. priced an iPhone 16 at $47,000, showing that this craze isn't just happening in the U.S.\n\nWhy The Rush?\n\nThe frenzy began on January 19, 2025, when TikTok went dark due to a law requiring ByteDance, its China-based parent company, to sell its U.S. operations. Though the app became usable again after 14 hours\u2014thanks to an executive order by President Donald Trump delaying enforcement\u2014it remained unavailable for download or updates. Users who deleted the app or got new phones found themselves out of luck.\n\nApple confirmed the app's removal from its App Store, stating, \"If you already have [TikTok] installed on your device, it will remain on your device, but it can't be redownloaded or restored if you move to a new device.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nTrending: Maker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing \u2014 you can become an investor for $0.80 per share today.\n\nThe Uncertain Future of TikTok\n\nTikTok's future in the U.S. is still unclear. Trump has floated the idea of a joint venture where the U.S. government would own a 50% stake in the app. He's also suggested potential buyers like Elon Musk or Oracle's Larry Ellison. Meanwhile, negotiations between ByteDance, the U.S. government, and other stakeholders are ongoing, with some experts predicting a resolution could happen within weeks.\n\nUntil then, TikTok users who still have the app installed can continue using it, though it may eventually become outdated without updates. For those who deleted the app, the only way to get it back is to shell out for one of these overpriced eBay listings.\n\nSee Also: Built on the trusted network of Fortune 500 companies, this blockchain company partners with Salesforce to uproot lengthy and expensive B2B transactions, and you can invest with just $100.\n\nUsers Desperate To Reconnect\n\nThe ban has left many TikTok fans frustrated. New York Post reports that online forums are flooded with users offering thousands of dollars for phones with the app. \"I deleted TikTok, and now I can't get it back!\" one person posted on social media, offering $5,000 for a phone with the app installed. Another shared their regret: \"I thought the ban was going to last a long time, so I deleted it, only to realize it was back hours later.\"\n\nWhile some have labeled the brief ban a political stunt, others are capitalizing on the situation. The exorbitant eBay listings highlight just how much people are willing to pay to get back on TikTok\u2014even if it's temporary. Whether the app's presence on the App Store is restored soon or not, one thing is clear: TikTok's grip on American users remains as strong as ever.\n\nRead Next:\n\nThey're saying this is the biggest breakthrough in Next-Gen Tech since the iPhone.

                "reasoning": "The news about the TikTok ban has created a temporary surge in demand for iPhones with the app installed, leading to inflated prices on eBay. This unusual market behavior may generate short-term interest in Apple products, potentially boosting sales and brand visibility. However, the long-term implications of the TikTok ban and its uncertain future could create volatility. Overall, the immediate impact seems positive for Apple, but the uncertainty surrounding TikTok's status may temper investor enthusiasm. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of stock price rise due to the current frenzy, but with a notable chance of decline due to potential market corrections or negative sentiment regarding the TikTok situation."

While this demonstrates TikTok's popularity and user frustration, it's unlikely to have a significant, lasting impact on Apple's overall financial performance or stock price. The situation is temporary, and the demand is driven by a specific, short-term event. The high prices on eBay are anecdotal and don't reflect a fundamental shift in Apple's business. The news is more relevant to TikTok and its parent company, ByteDance, than to Apple. Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock is expected to be minimal. The numerous advertisements within the article also suggest that the article is more promotional than informative."

The issue is isolated to a short-lived situation and doesn't reflect on Apple's overall performance or product demand.  The exorbitant prices are driven by scarcity and speculation, not by any fundamental change in Apple's business or market position.  Therefore, the probability of a stock price increase or decrease due to this news is very low."

                "reasoning": "The news highlights a surge in demand for iPhones with TikTok pre-installed due to the app's removal from the App Store, driven by a U.S. ban. While this indicates strong consumer attachment to TikTok, it does not directly impact Apple's core business metrics (e.g., iPhone sales, services revenue). The frenzy is a niche market phenomenon and unlikely to materially affect Apple's financial performance. However, the news could slightly boost sentiment around Apple's ecosystem strength. Conversely, if the ban escalates into broader U.S.-China tech tensions, it might introduce uncertainty, but this is not the focus of the current headline. Overall, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely neutral to slightly positive."

The ban is temporary, and TikTok's future in the U.S. is still uncertain but not directly related to Apple's core business performance. Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be neutral or minimal."

This situation is likely to have a positive impact on Apple's stock price, as it highlights the strong demand for Apple products and the willingness of consumers to pay a premium for them. However, the article also mentions that the ban is temporary and that negotiations are ongoing, which may lead to a resolution that could reduce the demand for these iPhones. Additionally, the article does not provide any information about the potential impact of the ban on Apple's overall sales or revenue. Considering these factors, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is higher than the probability of it falling, but not extremely high due to the uncertainty surrounding the situation."

        "content": "Apple AAPL is set to report its first-quarter fiscal 2025 results on Jan. 30.\r\n\r\nFind the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.\r\n\r\nApple expects the December quarter\u2019s (first-quarter fiscal 2025) revenues to grow low to mid-single digits on a year-over-year basis. Apple\u2019s fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 net sales increased 6.1% year over year to $94.93 billion.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal first-quarter revenues is currently pegged at $124.04 billion, indicating growth of 3.73% year over year. \r\n\r\nThe consensus mark for earnings is currently pegged at $2.36 per share, unchanged over the past 30 days. The figure indicates a 8.26% increase from the year-ago quarter.\n\nApple Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseApple Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nApple Inc. price-eps-surprise | Apple Inc. Quote\n\nAAPL\u2019s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the earnings surprise being 5.05%, on average.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.\n\nApple\u2019s iPhone Sales Likely to Fall in Fiscal Q1\n\nApple\u2019s fortunes are heavily reliant on the iPhone, which is by far its biggest revenue contributor. The device accounted for 48.7% of net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, wherein sales increased 5.5% year over year to $46.22 billion. \r\n\r\niPhone sales are likely to have suffered from stiff competition in China from Chinese vendors, including Huawei and Xiaomi. A delay in the launch of Apple Intelligence to a major part of Apple\u2019s installed base has been a concern.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal first-quarter iPhone net sales is pegged at $69.189 billion, suggesting 0.7% year-over-year decline.\n\nAAPL\u2019s Services Growth to Remain Steady in Fiscal Q1\n\nThe weakness in iPhone sales is expected to be partially negated by the steady growth of the Services segment. An expanding paid subscriber base has been a key catalyst for the Services business, which is riding on the increasing popularity of the App Store and an expanding installed base of devices, albeit with a worsening regulatory environment.\r\n\r\nApple has more than 1 billion paid subscribers across its Services portfolio, offering Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple News+, Apple Card, Apple Fitness+ and Apple One bundle. \r\n\r\nFor the Services segment, Apple expects a double-digit growth rate similar to fiscal 2024. The consensus mark for Services is currently pegged at $26.176 billion, suggesting 13.2% growth on a year-over-year basis.\n\nApple\u2019s Mac Sales to Rise Y/Y\n\nApple\u2019s Mac shipment is expected to have increased 17.3% year over year in the fourth quarter of calendar 2024, per IDC data. The iPhone maker is estimated to have shipped 7 million Macs, grabbing a market share of 10.1% compared with 8.8% in the year-ago quarter. \r\n\r\nApple\u2019s estimated shipment growth rate is the largest in IDC\u2019s vendor list, followed by ASUS and Lenovo\u2019s growth of 11.7% and 4.8%, respectively. Dell Technologies DELL and HP HPQ saw a shipment decline of 0.2% and 1.7%, respectively.\r\n\r\nIn terms of market share, Lenovo maintained the #1 position with 24.5%, trailed by HP and Dell Technologies\u2019 19.9% and 14.4%, respectively. Apple\u2019s market share improved from 8.8% in the year-ago quarter to 10.1%.\r\n\r\nIDC estimates 68.9 million sold units in the fourth quarter of 2024, up 1.8% year over year. In contrast, Gartner estimates shipment of 64.4 million units, up 1.4% year over year. In Gartner\u2019s list, ASUS gains the most in terms of shipments (up 9.8%), followed by Apple (shipments up 4.6%).\n\nStory Continues\n\nAAPL Shares Underperform Sector\n\nApple shares have returned 16.2%, underperforming the Zacks Computer & Technology sector\u2019s return of 27.5%.\n\nApple Stock\u2019s PerformanceZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nApple stock is not so cheap, as the Value Score of F suggests a stretched valuation at this moment.\r\n\r\nIn terms of the forward 12-month Price/Earnings, AAPL is trading at 28.97X, higher than the Zacks Computer & Technology sector\u2019s 27.54X.\n\nPrice/Earnings (F12M)Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAI Focus Aids AAPL\u2019s Prospects\n\nAAPL has been on the investors' radar thanks to its AI push with the introduction of Apple Intelligence, an advanced personal intelligence system seamlessly integrated into iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and macOS Sequoia.\r\n\r\nApple\u2019s AI push is expected to bring consumer-focused AI-enabled PCs into the market, thereby aiding PC shipments in the long haul. \r\n\r\nAAPL has been playing catch-up in the AI space compared with Alphabet, Microsoft MSFT and Amazon, its peers in the \u201cMagnificent 7\u201d group. Following the launch of Apple Intelligence, its competitive position is expected to improve.\r\n\r\nLeveraging the power of GenAI models, Apple Intelligence aims to enhance user experience across iPhone, iPad and Mac by combining robust language and image understanding with personal context. This technology, powered by Apple silicon, promises to simplify and accelerate everyday tasks while maintaining Apple\u2019s stringent privacy standards.\r\n\r\nThe Services business benefits from the growing demand for Apple TV+ content and the adoption of Apple Pay. It recently expanded Tap to Pay on iPhone to more markets, including the United Arab Emirates, Chile, Japan, Canada, Italy and Germany. Apple Pay is now available in countries like Egypt and Uruguay.\r\n\r\nThe expanding content portfolio for Apple TV+ is noteworthy.\n\nApple \u2013 China Headwind Makes the Stock a Risky Bet\n\nApple\u2019s near-term results are expected to bear the brunt of the weakness in China. A delay in the launch of Apple Intelligence is a concern, along with reported bugs. A stretched valuation is a concern.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Apple carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which implies that investors should avoid the stock right now. \r\n\r\nYou can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Additionally, Apple's focus on AI with Apple Intelligence could improve its competitive position in the long term.

Red Cat Holdings, Inc. RCAT\n\nRed Cat Holdings is a small cap company with a market cap of $701 million which makes drone technology for military, government, and commercial operations.\n\nShares of Red Cat Holdings are down 41% year-to-date, but the shares have soared 1003% over the last year. It's a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) but Zacks only has one earnings estimate.\n\nShould you take a chance on Red Cat Holdings?\n\n2. Barrick Gold Corp. GOLD\n\nBarrick Gold is a large cap global gold miner. Tracey talked about the gold trade, specifically with the miners, in a 2024 podcast because the price of gold was hitting new highs.\n\nShares of Barrick Gold are up 2.3% year-to-date but have only gained 1.5% over the last year. It's cheap, with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 9.7. 2025 earnings are expected to rise 30.3%.\n\nBarrick Gold is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.\n\nShould a gold miner, like Barrick Gold, be on your short list?\n\n3. Arista Networks Inc. ANET\n\nArista Networks is a leader in data-driven, cloud-to-client networking for large AI, data center, campus, and routing environments. It has a market cap of $163 billion.\n\nShares of Arista Networks have soared over the last year, rising 93.7%. In 2025, they're up another 15.9% to new all-time highs. Arista Networks isn't cheap.

It has a market cap of $7.3 billion.\n\nShares of Nio are down 5.7% year-to-date and have fallen 30.9% over the last year. Nio doesn't have a P/E ratio because it's earnings are still negative. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 is calling for a loss of $1.01.\n\nNio is a Zacks #3 (Hold) stock.\n\nWith shares trading near 5-year lows, should a smart car manufacturer like Nio be on your watch list?\n\n5. Apple Inc. AAPL\n\nApple is a Magnificent 7 stock and is one of the four pillars of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway empire. But shares of Apple have declined 11.3% year-to-date and are now \"only\" up 15.4% over the last year.\n\nBut even though the shares have weakened, Apple is not cheap. It still trades with a forward P/E ratio of 30.1. A P/E ratio under 15 is considered a value.\n\nApple also has a Zacks Rank of a 4, or Sell.\n\nIf Apple falls further, would it be a buying opportunity?\n\nWhat Else Do You Need to Know About These 5 Favorite Stocks?\n\nTune into this week's podcast to find out.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

Despite being a part of the 'Magnificent 7' and having a strong market presence, the high forward P/E ratio of 30.1 suggests that the stock is not considered cheap. The overall market sentiment and the Zacks Rank contribute to a higher probability of the stock price falling rather than rising in the short term."

                "reasoning": "The news article from Zacks Market Edge mentions Apple (AAPL) as one of the five stocks discussed in their podcast. While the article itself doesn't contain overwhelmingly positive or negative information, it highlights that Apple's stock is down 11.3% year-to-date, trades at a high forward P/E ratio of 30.1, and has a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell). This suggests a negative outlook. The article poses the question of whether further declines would present a buying opportunity, implying potential for further price drops. However, the mention of Apple as a 'Magnificent 7' stock and a key holding of Berkshire Hathaway provides some underlying stability. Given the negative signals from the Zacks Rank and year-to-date performance, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a price fall than a rise in the short term. The article is more of a neutral discussion point than a catalyst for significant movement."

                "reasoning": "The news mentions Apple (AAPL) as one of five stocks discussed in a Zacks Market Edge podcast.  The podcast host reviews the stock's performance, noting a year-to-date decline of 11.3% and a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell).  While the podcast discusses Apple's fundamentals, it doesn't offer any new significant information or predictions about the company's future performance. The Zacks Rank of 4 is a negative indicator, suggesting a bearish outlook. However, the mention in the podcast doesn't inherently cause a price movement; it simply summarizes existing information.  Therefore, the probability of price movement due to this news alone is low.  The probability of a price fall is slightly higher due to the Zacks Rank, but the overall impact is likely minimal."

Key points about Apple include: 1) It is a Magnificent 7 stock and a significant holding in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. 2) Shares have declined 11.3% year-to-date but are still up 15.4% over the last year. 3) The stock is considered expensive with a forward P/E of 30.1. 4) Apple has a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell). The negative sentiment around the stock's valuation and the Sell rating from Zacks suggest potential downward pressure. However, Apple's strong brand and historical performance may provide some support. The lack of specific positive catalysts in the news further weighs on the outlook."

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 January 27, 2025 \u2013 Zacks.com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises. This week\u2019s list Tesla TSLA, Microsoft MSFT, Meta Platforms META and Apple AAPL.\n\nMag 7 Earnings on Deck: A Closer Look\n\nThis week takes us into the heart of the Q4 earnings season, with more than 300 companies reporting results, including four Magnificent 7 members and 96 other S&P 500 members. We have Tesla, Microsoft and Meta Platforms on Wednesday, January 29th, and Apple on Thursday, January 30th.\n\nApple shares have struggled lately, with the stock lagging behind the Mag 7 group and the broader market. The stock hit the 52-week high around Christmas and has since lost about 15% of its value on persistent worries about China and its AI strategy.\n\nThe bounce in Tesla shares has more than made up for the market's disappointment with the Robo taxi announcement. Apple is the Mag 7 laggard this year.\n\nTesla shares have truly been on a tear since the last quarterly release on October 23rd, with the stock up more than +85% since the day before that release. Market participants appear convinced that Tesla's competitive challenges are behind it. We will see if this Wednesday's quarterly release validates this view.\n\nThe very positive sentiment on Tesla contrasts the dour views on Apple where some of the more bearish analysts are projecting a guidance cut. While estimates for the December quarter have been stable lately, estimates for the current and following fiscal years have been under pressure. The current Zacks Consensus EPS for fiscal year 2025 (ends in September) for Apple of $7.40 is down from $7.43 a week ago and $7.49 three months back.\n\nApple bulls see this all-around downbeat sentiment as overdone. While they acknowledge the China headwinds, they believe that the issue is manageable for the company and expect Apple to announce a local AI partner in the next few months. Baidu appears to be the front-line candidate, but analysts also mention Tencent and TikTok parent ByteDance as in the running.\n\nUnlike Tesla and Apple, the issue with Microsoft is the capex overhang, with the market concerned about the company's heavy investments in AI infrastructure without a tangible monetization plan.\n\nThe capex question isn't restricted to Microsoft alone, as Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta also face the same issue. Of these four, the problem is particularly central for Alphabet as many in the market see AI as potentially risking the company's search monopoly. Alphabet did a good job in its last earnings release on that front, but this will likely remain an ongoing issue in the Google story.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe group is expected to bring in +20.9% more earnings in Q4 relative to the same period last year on +12.2% higher revenues.\n\nAs we all know by now, the group's phenomenal boost in 2021 partly reflected pulled forward demand from future periods that got adjusted mostly in 2022. The group got back into 'regular/normal' growth mode in 2023, and the trend is expected to continue this year and beyond.\n\nQ4 Earnings Season Scorecard\n\nThrough Friday, January 24th, we have seen Q4 results from 78 S&P 500 members, or 15.6% of the index's total membership. Total earnings for these companies are up +17.4% from the same period last year on +6.2% higher revenues, with 83.3% beating EPS estimates and 66.7% beating revenue estimates.\n\nFor the Finance sector, we now have 45.5% of the sector's market capitalization in the S&P 500 index. Total earnings for these Finance sector companies are up +27.5% from the same period last year on +10.9% higher revenues, with all the companies beating EPS estimates (100%) and 80% surpassing revenue estimates.\n\nKey Earnings Reports This Week\n\nThe 100 S&P 500 members on deck to report results this week include several blue-chip operators like Boeing, GM, Starbucks, IBM, Southwest Airlines, Comcast, International Paper, and others, in addition to the aforementioned Mag 7 players.\n\nBy the end of this week, we will have seen Q4 results from more than 35% of the index's total membership.\n\nThe Earnings Big Picture\n\nExcluding contributions from the Mag 7 companies, S&P 500 earnings would have been up +5.7% on +3.8% higher revenues.\n\nPlease note that the very strong growth expected in 2025 is not driven by one or two sectors but is rather broad-based. All 16 Zacks sectors are expected to enjoy positive earnings growth in 2025, with 8 of the 16 Zacks sectors expected to achieve double-digit earnings growth.\n\nFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>> Earnings Picture Remains Strong: A Closer Look\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

However, the article also mentions that some bulls believe the negative sentiment is overdone and anticipate Apple announcing an AI partnership soon, potentially with Baidu.

Bearish analysts predict a guidance cut, and EPS estimates for future fiscal years have been revised downward. However, bullish analysts believe the negative sentiment is overblown and point to the potential announcement of a local AI partner in China as a positive catalyst.  The news itself is not definitively positive or negative, but rather presents a balanced view of the current situation, making it difficult to assign a high probability to either a price rise or fall.  The probability is weighted slightly towards a fall due to the existing negative sentiment and the possibility of a guidance cut."

The \u201cMag 7,\u201d the stock market darlings, have roared higher on the AI craze. \r\n\r\nThe seven stocks are Apple AAPL, Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet (GOOG,\u00a0GOOGL), Amazon AMZN, NVIDIA NVDA, Tesla TSLA and Meta Platforms META. Among the seven, Tesla, Microsoft and Meta Platform will be the first to report, with their releases scheduled after market close on Jan. 29. Apple is scheduled to report on Jan. 30, followed by Alphabet on Feb. 4 and Amazon on Feb. 6. NVIDIA is likely to report later next month. \r\n\r\nThe fourth-quarter earnings of the \u201cMag 7\u201d companies are expected to be up 20.9% from the same period last year on 12.2% higher revenues. This would follow the 32.9% earnings growth on 15.4% higher revenues in the third quarter. Per Bloomberg Intelligence, profits for the \u201cMag 7\u201d are projected to increase by 22% in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, the smallest jump since the first quarter of 2023 (read: Can \"Magnificent Seven\" ETFs Retain Their Glory in 2025?).\n\nStay up-to-date with all quarterly releases:See Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nTesla\r\n\r\nTesla has an Earnings ESP of +1.68% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). According to our methodology, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 increases the chances of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they\u2019re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\r\n\r\nThe electric carmaker saw a negative earnings estimate revision of a couple of cents over the past seven days for the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings indicates substantial year-over-year growth of 4.2% and revenue growth of 9.3%. The earnings track record of the company is moderate as it delivered a four-quarter average earnings surprise of 0.13%. The electric carmaker has gained about 55% in the last three months, outperforming the industry\u2019s average growth of 24%.\r\n\r\nTesla has made a solid comeback, especially after Trump's election victory, and reclaimed its trillion-dollar market cap. The EV maker is expected to benefit from Trump's administration for a number of reasons. Tesla has the scale and scope that is unmatched in the EV industry and this dynamic could give the EV maker a clear competitive advantage in a non-EV subsidy environment. Additionally, the potential for higher China tariffs would likely keep cheaper Chinese EV manufacturers like BYD and Nio (NIO) from flooding the U.S. market in the coming years. Trump\u2019s administration will also help expedite regulatory approval of the company's autonomous driving technology. \r\n\r\nHowever, Tesla stock took a hit as the company missed estimates for fourth-quarter deliveries and recorded its first year-over-year decline in full-year vehicle deliveries in the company's history. Trump, last week, rolled back pro-EV policies, which also weighed on shares. Tesla shares fell 12% in a month (read: Tesla Slips on Q4 Delivery Miss: ETFs in Focus).\r\n\r\nMicrosoft\r\n\r\nMicrosoft has an Earnings ESP of -2.43% and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Microsoft saw a negative earnings estimate revision of a penny over the past 30 days for the second quarter of fiscal 2025. Its earnings track record is impressive, with the fourth-quarter earnings surprise being 4.91%, on average. The Zacks Consensus Estimate indicates earnings growth of 6.8% and revenue growth of 10.8% from the year-ago quarter. Microsoft has gained about 4% over the past three months, underperforming the industry\u2019s average growth of 11.8%.\r\n\r\nThe world's largest software company is one of the biggest beneficiaries of the AI boom. It has been investing billions of dollars in expanding its global network of data centers and other physical infrastructure required to develop AI technology that can compose documents, make images and serve as a lifelike personal assistant at work or home. Though Azure growth will continue to slow down, Microsoft expects its AI business to be on track to bring in more than $10 billion in sales sometime in the next quarter.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft expects revenues of $68.1-$69.1 billion for the fiscal second quarter of 2025, implying 10.6% growth at the mid-point.\r\n\r\nMeta Platforms\r\n\r\nMeta Platforms has an Earnings ESP of +6.74% and Zacks Rank #3. The social media giant saw a solid earnings estimate revision of 15 cents for the fourth quarter over the past seven days. Analysts increasing estimates right before earnings \u2014 with the most up-to-date information possible \u2014 is a good indicator for the stock. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the yet-to-be-reported quarter indicates substantial year-over-year earnings growth of 29.5%. Revenues are expected to increase 17.1% year over year. Meta Platforms delivered an earnings surprise of 11.34%, on average, in the last four quarters. Shares of META have gained about 12% over the past three months, slightly ahead of the industry\u2019s average growth of 11.7%. \r\n\r\nMeta received a price target boost from a couple of analysts ahead of its earnings release. Wedbush raised the price target for the stock from 680 to 700 and BofA Global Securities lifted the price target to 710 from 660.\r\n\r\nThe world\u2019s largest social media platform expects to post revenues in the range of $45-$48 billion for the fourth quarter. However, Meta expects a \u201csignificant acceleration\u201d in infrastructure spending this year as it continues to pour money into developing AI. Chief executive Mark Zuckerberg pledged to spend significantly on infrastructure and other projects like the metaverse and AI-powered glasses. Meta plans to invest around $60 to $65 billion in AI in 2025, up from the $40 billion spent in 2024. Management also plans to launch its own GPUs by the end of the year. \r\n\r\nApple\r\n\r\nApple has an Earnings ESP of -1.51% and a Zacks Rank #4. Apple saw no earnings estimate revision over the past 30 days for the fiscal first quarter of 2025. The iPhone maker has a strong track record of positive earnings surprises. It delivered an average earnings surprise of 5.05% in the trailing four quarters. The Zacks Consensus Estimate indicates a modest year-over-year increase of 8.3% for earnings and 3.7% for revenues. The stock has underperformed the industry, having shed 4.6% over the past three months.\r\n\r\nThe iPhone manufacturer rolled out the first wave of Apple Intelligence applications on Oct. 28 and the second wave on Dec. 11. Since both AI applications are only for English-language users, these features haven\u2019t boosted sales of iPhone 16 handsets.\u00a0 As such, Jefferies downgraded Apple to underperform, which was rare. Apple expects to add AI features in other languages starting in April.\r\n\r\nOn the last earnings call, Apple offered weak sales guidance for the fiscal first quarter. It expects \u201clow to mid-single digit\u201d sales growth. \r\n\r\nAlphabet \r\n\r\nAlphabet has an Earnings ESP of +5.96% and Zacks Rank #3. It saw no earnings estimate revision over the past 30 days for the fourth quarter. The company\u2019s earnings surprise track record over the past four quarters is good, with the average being 11.84%. Earnings are expected to increase 29.3%, while revenues are expected to grow 12.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Internet behemoth has risen 20% in the last three months, outperforming the industry\u2019s average growth of 11.7%.\r\n\r\nGoogle is facing headwinds from antitrust lawsuits and intensifying competition in the AI space. Analysts are concerned about the impact of generative AI on Google's core search business.\r\n\r\nAmazon\r\n\r\nAmazon has an Earnings ESP of +8.62% and a Zacks Rank #2. The stock saw a positive earnings estimate revision of 4 cents over the past 30 days for the fourth quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate indicates a year-over-year earnings increase of 52.48% and substantial revenue growth of 10.1% for the to-be-reported quarter. Additionally, Amazon\u2019s earnings surprise history is impressive, with the four-quarter average surprise being 25.85%. The stock has risen 20% in the past three months, higher than the industry\u2019s growth of 11.7%.\r\n\r\nAmazon soared to new all-time highs last week, given its continued dominance in e-commerce and expanding footprint in cloud computing, advertising, and various other sectors. Amazon\u2019s AI business, already up by triple-digit percentages, is growing much faster than the cloud business at a comparable stage of evolution. The world's largest online retailer expects revenues in the range of $181.5-$188.5 billion for the fourth quarter of 2024. \r\n\r\nLike other tech companies, Amazon has been ramping up investments in data centers, chips and the power needed for AI workloads.\n\nStory Continues\n\nETFs to Tap\n\nGiven this, investors may want to invest in these stocks through ETFs.

While the overall expectation is for strong earnings growth from the group, the specific information for Apple is mixed. Apple has a negative Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), indicating a higher likelihood of underperformance. There were no earnings estimate revisions over the past 30 days. The company has a history of positive earnings surprises, but the guidance for the fiscal first quarter is weak, with expected 'low to mid-single digit' sales growth. Jefferies downgraded Apple to underperform. The rollout of AI applications has not yet boosted sales. Considering these factors, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise."

                "reasoning": "The news article provides mixed signals regarding Apple's upcoming earnings report. While Apple has a strong track record of positive earnings surprises (average 5.05% in the last four quarters), the current Zacks Consensus Estimate indicates only modest year-over-year growth (8.3% earnings, 3.7% revenue).  Furthermore, Apple's recent weak sales guidance and the Jefferies downgrade to \"underperform\" due to slow adoption of its AI features (limited to English initially) suggest potential downside risk. The negative Earnings ESP (-1.51%) and Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) further reinforce this concern.  However, Apple remains a dominant player in the tech sector, and the overall positive sentiment surrounding the \"Magnificent Seven\" and the AI boom could provide some upward pressure. Considering the mixed signals, a neutral to slightly negative outlook is more likely."

The positive aspects include: 1) Apple is one of the Magnificent Seven companies, which often receive significant investor attention. 2) The upcoming earnings report provides an opportunity for Apple to positively surprise the market. 3) Pfizer gains after activist investor forgoes board nominations, which indicates that there are some positive news in the market. However, the negative sentiment surrounding the tech sector and the potential impact of DeepSeek AI seem to outweigh the positive aspects in the short term. The Federal Reserve meeting adds uncertainty, but its direct impact on Apple is less immediate than the AI and earnings concerns. Given the initial negative reaction and the broader tech sector concerns, a slight downward pressure on Apple's stock price is more likely in the immediate short term.

The negative impact of DeepSeek AI on the tech sector is a significant headwind, suggesting a potential for a broader market downturn that could pull Apple down.  Apple's upcoming earnings report is a key event; strong results could mitigate the negative sentiment, while weak results would likely exacerbate the downward pressure. The Federal Reserve's interest rate decision adds further uncertainty, as higher rates generally negatively impact growth stocks like Apple.

        "content": "The upcoming report from Apple (AAPL) is expected to reveal quarterly earnings of $2.36 per share, indicating an increase of 8.3% compared to the year-ago period. Analysts forecast revenues of $124.04 billion, representing an increase of 3.7% year over year.\n\nThe current level reflects a downward revision of 1.1% in the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter over the past 30 days. This demonstrates how the analysts covering the stock have collectively reappraised their initial projections over this period.\n\nBefore a company announces its earnings, it is essential to take into account any changes made to earnings estimates. This is a valuable factor in predicting the potential reactions of investors toward the stock. Empirical research has consistently shown a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and the short-term price performance of a stock.\n\nWhile investors usually depend on consensus earnings and revenue estimates to assess the business performance for the quarter, delving into analysts' forecasts for certain key metrics often provides a more comprehensive understanding.\n\nGiven this perspective, it's time to examine the average forecasts of specific Apple metrics that are routinely monitored and predicted by Wall Street analysts.\n\nAccording to the collective judgment of analysts, 'Net Sales- Products' should come in at $97.64 billion. The estimate indicates a change of +1.2% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nAnalysts' assessment points toward 'Net Sales- Services' reaching $26.18 billion. The estimate suggests a change of +13.2% year over year.\n\nThe average prediction of analysts places 'Revenue- Mac' at $8.33 billion. The estimate indicates a change of +7% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nThe collective assessment of analysts points to an estimated 'Revenue- iPhone' of $69.19 billion. The estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -0.7%.\n\nBased on the collective assessment of analysts, 'Revenue- Wearables, Home and Accessories' should arrive at $12.55 billion. The estimate indicates a change of +5% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nThe consensus among analysts is that 'Revenue- iPad' will reach $7.39 billion. The estimate indicates a change of +5.2% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nThe combined assessment of analysts suggests that 'Geographic Revenue- Greater China' will likely reach $22.16 billion. The estimate indicates a change of +6.5% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nThe consensus estimate for 'Geographic Revenue- Europe' stands at $31.05 billion. The estimate points to a change of +2.2% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nStory Continues\n\nIt is projected by analysts that the 'Geographic Revenue- Rest of Asia Pacific' will reach $9.91 billion.

The overall sentiment is cautious, as reflected in the Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell), suggesting potential underperformance. The recent decline of 12.8% in shares compared to the S&P 500's positive performance further indicates bearish sentiment. While some revenue segments show growth, the iPhone revenue is projected to decline slightly, which could weigh on investor sentiment. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a higher likelihood of a stock price fall given the overall negative sentiment and recent performance."

While overall revenue and EPS are expected to increase year-over-year, there's a downward revision in EPS estimates over the past 30 days, which is a negative signal. The iPhone revenue is expected to decline slightly, which is a key concern given its importance to Apple's overall performance. Services revenue is a bright spot with strong growth. Geographic revenue is mixed, with growth in Greater China and Europe, but declines in Rest of Asia Pacific and Japan. The stock has underperformed the S&P 500 recently and has a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell), indicating potential underperformance.

                "reasoning": "The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the overall revenue and EPS are projected to increase slightly year-over-year, several key metrics show concerning trends.  The downward revision of EPS estimates over the past 30 days (-1.1%) is a significant negative indicator.  Furthermore, the projected decline in iPhone revenue (-0.7%) is particularly noteworthy given the iPhone's importance to Apple's overall revenue.  While some segments like Services show strong growth, the overall picture is one of modest growth in a challenging environment.  The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) rating further reinforces the negative sentiment.  Considering the downward revision of EPS, the negative performance of the stock (-12.8% in the last month) compared to the market, and the projected decline in iPhone revenue, the probability of a price fall is higher than a price rise."

Additionally, the stock has underperformed the S&P 500 recently, with a -12.8% return over the past month, and carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), suggesting potential underperformance. The revenue breakdown shows growth in services and some product lines (Mac, Wearables, iPad) but declines in iPhone and certain geographic regions (Rest of Asia Pacific, Japan).

Likewise, 63 percent of freshly launched iPads run on iPadOS 18; 53 percent of all active iPads run on the most recent version.\n\nApple's tool for app administration, App Store Connect, lets developers upload, publish, and oversee their apps more quickly. Improved sales and download tracking, complete financial management capabilities, and simplified procedures for app testing and in-app purchase administration constitute new features.\n\nApple has redesigned its App Review process to enhance developer success and provide a safer and more reliable surroundings for consumers. The new method provides better rules to assist developers in preparing their entries and solves typical causes of app rejections. The update also has a simpler appeals procedure for developers trying to get deleted applications back on line.\n\nApart from administration tools, Apple has included fresh business and marketing insights to support developers in raising app discoverability and user interaction. These tools include techniques for creating successful product pages, using pre-orders, and best using in-app purchasing capabilities. Deeper understanding of user behavior made possible by improved analytics helps developers to customize onboarding experiences and react more successfully to user evaluations.\n\nThese improvements, according to industry observers, would not only simplify the app creation process but also help Apple's position in the cutthroat app business to be strengthened. Apple wants to draw more developers to its platform by offering strong support and cutting-edge tools thus promoting creativity and increasing the spectrum of accessible apps for consumers.\n\nApple's constant investment in the App Store ecosystem emphasizes its will to maintain a safe and vibrant market, thereby assuring that both customers and developers benefit from a flawless and quick app experience.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

        "content": "Monday's swift sell-off in the markets serves as a reminder for not only what's been the driving force of the bull market thus far, but also what investors have been expecting to come in 2025. It's all about big tech earnings.\n\nNew developments from Chinese artificial intelligence DeepSeek sparked the rout as investor concerns over brewing competition in the AI space for Nvidia (NVDA) and other big tech names prompted pause in the US AI trade.\n\nNvidia stock was set to open lower by more than 11%. Meanwhile fellow \"Magnificent Seven\" members Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL,GOOG), Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN) and Tesla (TSLA) were all off about 5% or more in pre-market trading. Broadcom (AVGO), another large player in the AI space, was down more than 12%.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(ES=F)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nA slowdown in Big tech's rapid earnings growth has been a risk to the market that strategists have been talking about for more than a year. With with index valuations near multi-decade highs and the 10 largest stocks comprising nearly 40% of the S&P 500, strategists have argued the rapid rally in stocks is increasingly on thin ice.\n\nBut unlike other risks like higher interest rates or sticky inflation, there hasn't been a clear story for why the exceptional Big Tech earnings growth story would collapse. For now, this weekend's DeepSeek AI model launch appears to be a tangible reason for investors to question whether the high earnings expectations will truly follow through.\n\nIn 2024, Magnificent Seven earnings outperformed the rest of the S&P 500 index by 30 percentage points, per research from Goldman Sachs. And while that margin is expected to slow in the year ahead, causing some to call for a broadening out of stock market returns, big tech earnings growth remains a key pillar of the bull market thesis.\n\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks are expected to grow earnings by 21.7% in the fourth quarter compared to the 9.7% earnings growth projected for the other 493 tech stocks. The year-over-year growth rate for the \"Magnificent Seven\" is expected to slow in the first quarter, before accelerating once more to year-over-year earnings growth of more than 24% in the third quarter.\n\nAs Venu Krishna, head of US equity strategy at Barclays, pointed out in his 2025 outlook, given the large earnings growth expected for Big Tech throughout the year, the group is \"likely to remain as critical of an EPS growth driver for the S&P 500 as the group was [in 2024].\"NEW YORK, NEW YORK - JANUARY 22: Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange during morning trading on January 22, 2025 in New York City.

The concerns over competition in the AI space, particularly from DeepSeek, have led to a broader market reaction that could negatively impact investor sentiment towards Apple. Given that Apple is part of the 'Magnificent Seven', which is expected to see a slowdown in earnings growth, the probability of a stock price fall is higher. However, the long-term outlook for big tech remains strong, which could mitigate some immediate negative impacts.

The DeepSeek sell-off and the pre-market drops in other 'Magnificent Seven' stocks indicate investor concern. While the article mentions the continued expectation of strong earnings growth for these companies, the emergence of a tangible reason to question those expectations (DeepSeek) introduces uncertainty. Apple, as a member of the 'Magnificent Seven' and a company with AI ambitions, is likely to be affected by this sentiment. The overall market reaction suggests a higher probability of a short-term price decrease. However, the article also points out that the expected earnings growth for the Magnificent Seven is still strong, which could mitigate the negative impact.

While Apple is mentioned as part of the 'Magnificent Seven,' the article doesn't directly address Apple-specific news or factors. The sell-off is primarily attributed to concerns about the slowing growth of big tech earnings and the potential for this trend to continue.  Apple's performance is heavily tied to the overall tech sector's health. Given the negative sentiment surrounding the broader tech market due to the DeepSeek news and the general concerns about slowing earnings growth, it's more likely that Apple will experience a short-term negative impact. However, Apple's strong brand and diverse product portfolio might offer some resilience compared to companies more directly involved in the AI race.

The article suggests that the rapid earnings growth of big tech, a key driver of the bull market, is being questioned due to the emergence of competitive AI models. Given the broader market sentiment and the direct impact on tech stocks, Apple is likely to face downward pressure in the short term.

        "content": "Meta Wants To Leverage TikTok Ban Threat to Promote Instagram On Other Social Media, Offers Cash Deals\n\nMeta\u00a0Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) is trying to promoteInstagram by exploiting the absence of the Chinese rival TikTok download option from Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google stores.\n\nIn 2020, President Donald Trump threatened to ban TikTok, citing national security threats due to its ownership by ByteDance Ltd. However, recently, Trump urged the Supreme Court to delay the TikTok ban after assuming charge as the new President on January 20.\n\nAlso Read: BYD, Geely, SAIC Contest EU\u2019s High EV Tariffs In Court\n\nPreviously, the Biden administration ordered ByteDance to divest its ownership of TikTok or face an effective ban on the app in the U.S. on January 19.\n\nTikTok, has 170 million U.S. users and accounts for ~4% of the U.S. digital ad market. Around 63% of teens aged 13 to 17 use TikTok compared to 59% who use Instagram, CNBC cites a 2023\u00a0Pew Research Center survey.\n\nThe Facebook and Instagram parent encouraged creators to promote Instagram on other short-form video apps, like TikTok, Snap Inc (NYSE:SNAP) Snapchat, and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) YouTube including three months of posting exclusivity by doling out attractive offers, CNBC cites from a creator contract details.\n\nMeta\u2019s monthly cash bonuses ranged from $10,000 to $50,000 to shift their videos to Instagram Reels, CNBC cites the Information. The deals last six months and obligate a creator to post a minimum of eight Instagram Reels per month.\n\nMeta paid over $2 billion to content creators\u00a0in 2024. Four million content creators have reportedly made money from the platform since 2017.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump allies, includingOracle Corp (NYSE:ORCL) co-founder and Chairman\u00a0Larry Ellison and Elon Musk, emerged as eligible contenders for\u00a0TikTok after Trump suspended the TikTok ban for 75 days.\n\nMETA Stock Prediction For 2025\n\nEquity research analysts on and off Wall Street typically use earnings growth and fundamental research as a form of valuation and forecasting. But many in trading turn to technical analysis as a way to form predictive models for share price trajectory.\n\nSome investors look to trends to help forecast where they believe a stock could trade at a certain point in the future. Looking at Meta Platforms, an investor could make an assessment about a stock's long term prospects using a moving average and trend line. If they believe a stock will remain above the moving average, which many believe is a bullish signal, they can extrapolate that trend into the future using a trend line. For Meta Platforms, the 200-day moving average sits at $536.57, according to Benzinga Pro, which is below the current price of $647.49. For more on charts and trend lines, see a description here.\n\nStory Continues\n\nTraders believe that when a stock is above its moving average, it is a generally bullish signal, and when it crosses below, it is a more negative signal. Investors could use trend lines to make an educated guess about where a stock could trade at a later date if conditions remain stable.\n\nInvestors can gain exposure to Meta through iShares U.S. Technology ETF (NYSE:IYW) and Global X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF (NASDAQ:AIQ).\n\nPrice Action: META stock is down 1.57% at $637.71 premarket at the last check on Monday.\n\nAlso Read:\n\nQualcomm Gains $2 Billion Boost From Samsung S25 Chipset Deal, Analyst Highlights Growth in Handsets and Beyond\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

However, the focus is on Meta's promotional efforts rather than any direct impact on Apple's business. Given that Apple is not directly involved in the TikTok situation and the overall market sentiment towards tech stocks remains cautious, the probability of AAPL's stock price rising is moderate, while the probability of it falling is slightly higher due to potential market volatility and investor reactions to competitive pressures."

                "reasoning": "The news presents a mixed bag for Apple (AAPL). On one hand, Meta's attempt to capitalize on a potential TikTok ban could indirectly benefit Apple by increasing Instagram usage, which is available on the App Store. However, the news primarily focuses on Meta's strategy and doesn't directly impact Apple's core business or revenue streams. The article also mentions potential delays or reversals of the TikTok ban, which would negate any potential benefit to Instagram and, by extension, Apple. Given the indirect and uncertain nature of the impact, the probability of a significant stock price movement for Apple is relatively low. The current premarket price action of META being down suggests a slightly negative sentiment in the market, which could indirectly affect AAPL as well. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a price fall than a rise."

While this might indirectly benefit Instagram and thus Meta, the impact on Apple is extremely tenuous and likely negligible.  The article primarily discusses Meta's strategies and financial performance, not Apple's.  Apple's stock price movement is unlikely to be significantly affected by Meta's efforts to promote Instagram. Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price changing due to this news is very low, with the probabilities being almost equally distributed between a rise and a fall, reflecting the lack of direct connection."

While this could be seen as a positive move for Meta (META) to capture more market share in the short-form video space, the direct impact on Apple Inc. (AAPL) is minimal. Apple's stock price is unlikely to be significantly affected by this news as it does not directly pertain to Apple's core business operations or financial performance. The news does mention Apple's App Store in the context of TikTok's absence, but this is not a material factor for Apple's stock movement. Therefore, the probabilities of a rise or fall in AAPL's stock price due to this news are both low."

Nevertheless, as Apple is mentioned as one of the companies that removed TikTok from its app store, there might be a slight positive effect on Apple's stock price due to the potential decrease in competition for its own video-sharing features.

        "content": "We recently published a list of 10 AI Stocks Making Waves on Wall Street. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other AI stocks making waves on Wall Street.\n\nThe moment of reckoning has arrived: China\u2019s artificial intelligence industry has almost caught up with the US. Moreover, it is more open and efficient too. This is unlike the US\u2019s strategy towards the nascent technology, which it wants to keep largely within its borders. To recap President Donald Trump\u2019s first week in office, it is safe to say that the message towards the community has been simple: Build, build, and build.\n\nWhen he came to office, Trump immediately rescinded Biden\u2019s sweeping executive order on AI. While AI with fewer guardrails may be terrifying for some, it may be a possible way to expand into new territories and win the race toward AI. In light of this, Trump has recently signed an executive order related to AI to \u201cmake America the world capital in artificial intelligence\u201d.\n\nREAD ALSO: Top 10 Trending AI Stocks on Wall Street and 11 AI Stocks That Should Be On Your Watchlist\n\nThe President has also announced a joint venture led by SoftBank Group Corp., OpenAI, and Oracle Corp. The \u201cStargate initiative\u201d will fund billions of dollars worth of AI infrastructure. On the eve of taking office, President Trump said that he would allow \u201cpeople with a lot of money\u201d to invest in so-called \u201cAI plants\u201d that power data centers for artificial intelligence.\n\nTrump\u2019s actions signal the direction AI policy is going to take under his reign, particularly when it comes to competing with China. Meanwhile, both China and the US are doing everything in their power to win the AI race. Back in September, OpenAI released the world\u2019s first reasoning model, o1, which used a \u201cchain of thought\u201d to answer difficult questions. Other companies soon followed suit. Google developed its own reasoning model called \u201cGemini Flash Thinking\u201d in December and a few days later, o3 was born.\n\nKeeping a close tab on these developments, China has recently made a mark of its own, igniting panic in Silicon Valley along the way. An AI lab, known as DeepSeek, unveiled a free, open-source large-language model in late December. According to the lab, it took only two months and less than $6 million to build the model, using reduced-capability chips from Nvidia called H800s.\n\nThird-party benchmark tests have revealed how DeepSeek\u2019s model outperformed Meta\u2019s Llama 3.1, OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o, and Anthropic\u2019s Claude Sonnet 3.5 in accuracy ranging from complex problem-solving to math and coding. If this wasn\u2019t enough, DeepSeek, last Monday, released r1, a reasoning model that has outperformed OpenAI\u2019s latest o1 in several of these third-party tests.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u201cTo see the DeepSeek new model, it\u2019s super impressive in terms of both how they have really effectively done an open-source model that does this inference-time compute, and is super-compute efficient. We should take the developments out of China very, very seriously\u201d.\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s r1 is particularly remarkable considering it also had to navigate the strict semiconductor restrictions that the U.S. government has imposed on China. These restrictions had cut the country off from access to the most powerful chips, like Nvidia\u2019s H100s. The development also implies how the AI lab either found a way around the rules or, the controls were simply not as effective as anticipated. Does this mean that Trump\u2019s stance toward fewer guardrails is the way to go? We are yet to find out.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Apple Inc. (AAPL): Strengthening AI Leadership with Apple Intelligence\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that has strengthened its mark in the AI realm by launching Apple Intelligence, its personal intelligence system. On January 24, BofA analyst Wamsi Mohan lowered the firm\u2019s price target on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to $253 from $256 and kept a \u201cBuy\u201d rating on the shares. The rating has been issued ahead of the company reporting fiscal Q1 results. The company will report its results after market close on Thursday, January 30. Even though the firm expects a \u201cstrong report\u201d from Apple due to the iPhone 16\u2019s initial demand, it has also lowered its fiscal Q2 iPhone units estimate to 49M from 56M. The analyst cited two reasons for the lowered outlook: a weak macro environment and the prolonged rollout of generative artificial intelligence features. The firm further said investors already know about the weak iPhone sales, reiterating a Buy rating based on Apple\u2019s strong profit margins, future improvements, and robust cash flow.\n\n\u201cPartly due to the weak macro and partly due to the staggered launch of Apple Intelligence features,\u00a0which we\u00a0see as yet to gain widespread adoption, we lower our F2Q (March\u00a0quarter) iPhone units estimate to 49 million (from 56 million),\u201d Mohan wrote.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of AI stocks making waves on Wall Street. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "headline": "Should You Buy Berkshire Hathaway Stock Before Jan. 30?",
        "content": "To say that Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) has been a big winner for investors over the long term would be an understatement. Between 1964 and 2023, Berkshire's overall gain was a jaw-dropping 4,384,748% -- more than 140 times greater than the S&P 500's gain during the period. Berkshire has also outperformed the S&P 500 since the end of 2023.\n\nThere could be a reason to invest in the conglomerate led by Warren Buffett sooner rather than later. The question is: Should you buy Berkshire Hathaway stock before Jan. 30?\n\nWhat's special about Jan. 30?\n\nYou might be wondering what's special about that date. No, Berkshire Hathaway isn't scheduled to report its latest quarterly results then. The company's next quarterly update will probably come in late February. Neither has Berkshire announced any other special event for this week.\n\nHowever, another company will report its results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 on Jan. 30 -- Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). And it could be one of Apple's more important updates in quite a while. Investors will be especially interested in learning how Apple Intelligence, the bundle of new generative AI features available with iOS 18, affected iPhone sales.\n\nWhy does Apple's quarterly update matter to Berkshire Hathaway? Even though Buffett has reduced his company's stake in the consumer technology giant in recent quarters, Apple remains by far the largest holding in Berkshire's portfolio. Berkshire is the sixth largest institutional shareholder, owning around 2% of Apple.\n\nWhat history shows\n\nBerkshire's position in Apple currently makes up roughly 6.7% of the conglomerate's market cap. That's a significant enough level that Apple's performance matters to Berkshire. But just how much does it matter?\n\nOver the past five years, the correlation coefficient between Apple's and Berkshire's stock performances using monthly returns is 0.49. That's a moderate correlation; 1.0 is very strong.\n\nCould Berkshire Hathaway's share price jump if Apple reports exceptionally great results later this week, though? Maybe. However, if history is any guide, don't count on it.\n\nFor example, Apple blew past Wall Street's expectations with its fiscal 2020 third-quarter results, reported on July 30, 2020. The company also announced a 4-for-1 stock split that excited investors. Apple stock promptly soared 10.5% the next day. Berkshire Hathaway's share price increased by less than 1%, a ho-hum move despite Apple's great quarterly update.\n\nStory Continues\n\nOn Jan. 27, 2022, Apple again posted terrific results. Apple CEO Tim Cook's comments about increased investment in augmented reality also captured investors' attention. Apple stock jumped 7% the following day. What about Berkshire Hathaway? Its shares also rose, but by a much less impressive 1.7%.\n\nBuy Berkshire Hathaway stock?\n\nSo should you scramble to buy Berkshire Hathaway stock before Apple reports its results on Jan. 30? Probably not. The better question, in my view, is: Should you buy Berkshire stock regardless of what happens with Apple?\n\nThere's a reasonably solid argument that you shouldn't buy Berkshire. Even Buffett doesn't seem to think his own stock is a great pick right now. After six straight years of stock buybacks, Berkshire didn't repurchase any of its shares in the third quarter of 2024.\n\nThat appears to be a clear sign Buffett doesn't view the valuation of the company he runs as attractive. Indeed, Berkshire trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 23.6. That's more expensive than the stock has been in a while.\n\nAnalysts aren't predicting exceptional growth for Berkshire Hathaway anytime soon, either. The consensus Wall Street estimate is that the conglomerate's revenue will increase by less than 1% in 2025, with earnings per share rising by roughly 2%.\n\nDespite these concerns, though, I still think Berkshire Hathaway is a good stock for investors to own over the long term. Its businesses generate reliable cash flow. Berkshire offers almost ETF-like diversification, with its subsidiaries and equity holdings spanning a wide range of industries. The company also has a massive cash stockpile that it can put to good use when stocks are valued more attractively.\n\nI don't think there's any reason to rush to invest in Berkshire.

                "reasoning": "The news discusses the upcoming earnings report of Apple, which is significant for Berkshire Hathaway due to its substantial investment in Apple. However, historical data shows that even when Apple reports strong results, Berkshire's stock price tends to react minimally. Given the current market conditions and Buffett's lack of recent stock buybacks, there is skepticism about Berkshire's valuation and growth potential. Therefore, while there is a chance of a slight rise in Berkshire's stock price if Apple performs well, the overall sentiment leans towards a neutral to slightly negative outlook, leading to a higher probability of a price fall."

                "reasoning": "The news article primarily focuses on Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A/BRK.B) and its relationship with Apple (AAPL). While Apple's earnings report on January 30th is mentioned, the article suggests that Apple's performance has a limited impact on Berkshire Hathaway's stock price. Historical data shows a moderate correlation between the two stocks, but past instances of strong Apple earnings reports did not lead to significant gains for Berkshire. The article also points out that Berkshire's valuation is currently high, and analysts are not predicting strong growth. Furthermore, Berkshire itself hasn't been buying back its shares, suggesting that it doesn't see its own stock as particularly attractive at the moment. Therefore, the news is unlikely to cause a significant rise in Apple's stock price. The article does not contain any negative information about Apple, so a significant fall is also unlikely. The article is primarily about Berkshire Hathaway, and the analysis suggests that Apple's earnings report is unlikely to have a significant impact on Berkshire's stock price. Therefore, the news is unlikely to cause a significant rise or fall in Apple's stock price."

While Apple is Berkshire's largest holding, the historical correlation between their stock price movements is only moderate (0.49). Past instances show that even strong Apple earnings reports have resulted in only minor increases in Berkshire Hathaway's stock price.  The article also highlights concerns about Berkshire Hathaway's valuation and lack of recent stock buybacks, suggesting that even positive news from Apple might not significantly impact Berkshire's stock price.  Therefore, the probability of a significant price movement in either direction for Berkshire Hathaway based solely on this news is low.  The analysis primarily concerns Berkshire Hathaway, not Apple.  The article mentions Apple's earnings report as a potential catalyst for *Berkshire Hathaway's* stock price movement, not Apple's own.

Historical data shows a moderate correlation (0.49) between the two stocks, but past instances indicate that Berkshire's stock price movement is relatively muted compared to Apple's, even when Apple reports strong results. The article also highlights that Berkshire's valuation is currently not attractive, with no recent buybacks and modest growth expectations. Therefore, while Apple's results might have some influence, the direct impact on Berkshire's stock price is likely limited.

The article suggests that Berkshire Hathaway's stock might not be directly impacted by Apple's results.

Additionally, the article mentions that Warren Buffett doesn't seem to think Berkshire Hathaway's stock is a great pick right now, and analysts aren't predicting exceptional growth for the company. However, the article concludes that Berkshire Hathaway is still a good stock to own over the long term due to its reliable cash flow, diversification, and massive cash stockpile. Since the news is more focused on Berkshire Hathaway than Apple, and the article doesn't provide a strong bullish or bearish sentiment towards Apple, the probability of Apple's stock price rising or falling due to this news is relatively low."

        "headline": "Meet the Stock Warren Buffett Has the Utmost Confidence In -- He's Been a Buyer for 24 of the Last 25 Quarters",
        "content": "When Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) CEO Warren Buffett speaks, investors wisely pay attention. That's because the appropriately dubbed \"Oracle of Omaha\" has overseen a cumulative return in his company's Class A shares (BRK.A) of more than 5,570,000% spanning six decades.\n\nBuffett's keys to success are no secret. Whether it's in his annual letter to shareholders or during the question-and-answer session at Berkshire's annual meeting, he lays out his game plan to for building wealth on Wall Street and keeping emotions in check. Berkshire's chief is a value-oriented, long-term investor who primarily focuses on businesses with sustainable competitive advantages and strong management teams.\n\nBut when overseeing a 44-stock, $296 billion investment portfolio, it can be tough to tell which, if any, stocks the Oracle of Omaha has the most confidence in.Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nApple, AmEx, and Bank of America are large holdings -- but none are Buffett's favorite stock\n\nLogic would dictate that the three largest holdings by market value in Berkshire Hathaway's investment portfolio are the company's Warren Buffett has the utmost confidence in... but this isn't necessarily the case.\n\nTech giant Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) has consistently been Berkshire's top holding for years, and remains a company Buffett speaks highly about. Aside from the iPhone being the market share-leading smartphone in the U.S., Apple's capital-return program is world-leading. More than $725 billion worth of the company's stock has been repurchased since the start of 2013, which has demonstrably improved its earnings per share (EPS).\n\nHowever, Buffett and his top advisors, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, have also overseen the sale of more than 615 million shares of Apple stock between Oct. 1, 2023 and Sept. 30, 2024. Even if this selling is purely for tax purposes, it likely rules out Apple as the stock Buffett has the most confidence in.\n\nCredit-services provider American Express(NYSE: AXP) has worked its way up to No. 2 spot in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. \"AmEx,\" as American Express is more commonly known, was labeled an \"indefinite\" holding in Buffett's letter to shareholders last year. Berkshire's investment team likely appreciate AmEx's ability to play both sides of the transaction counter, with the company generating payment processing fees from merchants, as well as annual fees and interest income from cardholders.\n\nYet it's been a long time since Buffett purchased shares of American Express. If this were truly Buffett's favorite company, he would likely add to the position.\n\nStory Continues\n\nBerkshire Hathaway's third-largest holding, Bank of America(NYSE: BAC), is a similar story to Apple. It's a company whose management team has received praise in the past from Buffett. BofA is the most interest-sensitive of America's money-center banks and it benefited immensely from the Federal Reserve's aggressive rate-hiking cycle from March 2022 through July 2023.\n\nBut since July 17, 2024, required Form 4 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) show that Berkshire's top investment minds (led by Buffett) have sold 26% (about 266.5 million shares) of their Bank of America stake.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe Oracle of Omaha has purchased this stock in 24 out of the last 25 quarters\n\nInterestingly enough, the stock Warren Buffett appears to have the utmost confidence in is a company that doesn't show up in Berkshire's quarterly filed Form 13Fs with the SEC. This is the form investors use to track the purchase and selling activity at Buffett's company.\n\nRather, detailed purchasing activity of this \"favorite stock\" can be found in Berkshire Hathaway's quarterly operating results. On the page prior to the beginning of the executive certifications, investors will find a breakdown of how many shares of Berkshire Hathaway Class A and B (BRK.B) stock the Oracle of Omaha purchased during the quarter. Perhaps it's fitting that the stock Buffett buys most and has the utmost confidence in is shares of his own company.\n\nHowever, buying shares of Berkshire Hathaway stock hasn't always been easy for Warren Buffett. Prior to July 2018, shares could only be repurchased if Berkshire's stock fell to or below 120% of book value. Unfortunately (for Buffett), this is a threshold Berkshire Hathaway's stock never dipped to or below, which led to no buyback activity.\n\nOn July 17, 2018, Berkshire's board reworked the rules governing buybacks to give its CEO more freedom to buy shares of the company he's clearly the most confident in. Under the new criteria, share repurchases have no end date or cap as long as Berkshire has at least $30 billion in combined cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasuries, and Buffett views his company's stock as intrinsically cheap. This last part is intentionally vague and allows Buffett to deploy his company's capital toward buybacks as he sees fit.\n\nEven though Buffett didn't repurchase shares of his company's stock in the September-ended quarter, he had done so in each of the previous 24 quarters, with a cumulative $78 billion spent on buybacks.\n\nAside from these repurchases reinforcing Buffett's belief that Berkshire Hathaway is ideally positioned to take advantage of lengthy periods of economic expansion, these buybacks serve two additional purposes.\n\nFor one, steadily reducing the company's outstanding share count is incrementally increasing the ownership stakes of Berkshire's investors. This goes a long way to incentivizing the long-term ethos that Buffett's late right-hand man, Charlie Munger, helped to instill.\n\nThe other purpose behind these buybacks is to make Berkshire's stock more fundamentally attractive. Companies with steady or growing net income and a declining outstanding share count can expect their EPS to increase over time.\n\nWith Berkshire Hathaway closing out the third quarter with a record $325.2 billion in (combined) cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasuries on its balance sheet, it seems only logical to expect Buffett to buy shares of the stock nearest and dearest to his heart in 2025.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

This suggests that Apple is actively exploring and investing in AI technology, which could be perceived as a positive development for the company's future growth and innovation.

        "content": "We recently published an article titled Jim Cramer Discusses These 18 Stocks & President Trump's $500 Billion AI Plan.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.\n\nIn his latest appearance on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer had a lot to say about a lot of stocks. Along with stocks, he was also full of comments about the new Trump administration and how it's different from the previous one. Cramer shared, \"If you go back over the councils that were disbanded post-Charlottesville, what you would see are a lot of traditional industrialists and drug companies.\" According to him, \"These were the people that were not drawn to, by Elon Musk. Elon Musk has changed the equation\" to increase the role that technology companies and executives are playing this time around.\n\nCommenting further on Musk, Cramer shared, \"Now, by the way, there's a lot of talk now about where is Elon Musk?\" This means wondering where he is \"in terms of having people in powerful positions say, in the Defense Department.\" Cramer believes that Musk \"doesn't seem to have them\" and added, \"If Musk wants to be meaningful, I don't want a seat at the table, I want a table.\"\n\nThe CNBC host also mentioned some industries that will benefit from AI. As part of a discussion about the returns from the multiple billions of dollars that firms have invested into AI, Cramer cautioned not to \"forget healthcare.\" He believes \"Healthcare's gonna be a very big, very big part of AI. David, it's not yet. And we need that, well-meaning people who believe in the industry have to have what people who are more than just trying to figure out how to make it so there's a call center that's better.\"\n\nCramer also shared his thoughts about the breadth of market performance during the day. While markets were rising, he noted, \"Yet the S&P oscillator I follow, [inaudible] is slightly overbought, there's a lot more room.\" Cramer believes \"there's a considerable part of the market that has done nothing. Nothing for years. And that's coming on.\" He doesn't like small-cap stocks either. \"And I'm not a small cap aficionado,\" Cramer commented. He believes, \"That stuff doesn't work. People always try to chin that up. And then somebody sells a big small cap derivative.\" The host added that instead of small-cap stocks, he likes \"companies that frankly, what we, you know we didn't think all that much of the second tier tech companies that are really taking off. The semis that haven't done anything lately.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nAs for President Trump, Cramer believes that he needs to look at insurance costs that affect a large number of Americans. According to him:\n\n\"The President has to take a look at these issues. Because this is where the, the copay, your insurance, your group insurance, your property, casualty insurance. That's where the President's going to put it. If he wants to put a stake in the inflation. He goes after the pharmacy benefits managers.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired on January 22nd.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) The Best Bear Market Stock To Invest In Now?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been a regular feature of Cramer's morning appearances this year. He believes that investors who evaluate the stock primarily through the lens of China smartphone sales are missing the broader picture. Cramer also dismissed Mark Zuckberberg's comments in Joe Rogan's podcast which claimed that innovation had stopped at Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) since Tim Cook took cover. More recently, he believes that the firm will post disappointing quarter results. Here is what he said:\n\n\"I said last night it's going to miss. We sold some stock because it became too big a part of our portfolio. I think it's going lower, I think they'll miss the quarter. I think there's another two or three analysts are going to try to downgrade it ahead of time. So they can upgrade it after they report the quarter. I do think it's a longer term, the stock is up thousands of percent since every single time it gets downgraded people sell it. That's all I'm saying. That's all I'm saying.\"\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

This sentiment suggests a bearish outlook on AAPL, which could lead to increased selling pressure. Additionally, Cramer's comments about potential downgrades from analysts further support the likelihood of a price decline. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of it rising."

While it highlights Jim Cramer's past positive views and the company's strong hedge fund ownership, it also emphasizes his recent decision to sell some AAPL stock due to portfolio size concerns and his expectation of a disappointing quarter. Cramer's anticipation of analyst downgrades further contributes to a potentially negative short-term sentiment.

While he anticipates Apple missing its quarterly earnings and predicts further downgrades before an eventual upgrade, he also notes the stock's historical performance following downgrades (it tends to rise).  His comments are mixed; while expressing concern about the near-term performance, he doesn't outright recommend selling. The overall tone suggests a cautious outlook rather than a strong bearish prediction.  The article also highlights Cramer's preference for AI stocks, which could indirectly influence investor sentiment away from Apple. Considering the mixed signals and the fact that Cramer's opinions are not always predictive, the probabilities are assigned accordingly."

However, he acknowledges AAPL's long-term growth potential, noting its historical performance despite downgrades.

        "content": "Costco (COS) did something this past week that is unusual for a company operating in the new Trump era \u2014 successfully push back against a challenge to its diversity efforts.\n\nThe giant retailer urged its stockholders to defeat a shareholder resolution from the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR), a conservative think tank, that would have forced the company to evaluate risks from its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) practices.\n\nThe measure was roundly defeated, with 98% of investors siding with the company.\n\n\"Our position on these issues is not new,\" Costco\u2019s board chairman Tony James said about the company\u2019s DEI stance during an annual shareholders meeting last Thursday.A cart wrangler gathers shopping carts outside a Costco warehouse in Sheridan, Colo. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski, File)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\n\"We have always been purposefully nonpolitical, and a welcoming workforce has been integral to the company's culture and values since its founding,\u201d James added.\n\nAn NCPPR official said Costco won the vote by aligning with conflicted asset managers and proxy advisers that profit from DEI and ESG (environmental, social, and governance) policies.\n\n\"While we are disappointed by the result, we are also not surprised, given the forces aligned against us,\" said Stefan Padfield, NCPPR\u2019s Free Enterprise Project executive director.\n\nMany prominent companies are backing away from DEI policies as corporate diversity goals come under intensifying scrutiny in Washington, D.C. President Donald Trump signed an executive order on his first day in office that ends federal DEI programs and orders US agencies to \"combat illegal private sector DEI actions.\"\n\n\u201cMy administration has taken action to abolish all discriminatory diversity, equity, and inclusion nonsense,\u201d Trump told business leaders and politicians last Thursday during a virtual address to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.People follow a virtual speech of U.S. president Donald Trump at the Annual Meeting of World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. (AP Photo/Markus Schreiber)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nOver the past year, a number of high-profile companies have done about-faces on diversity, including Meta (META), Walmart (WMT), McDonald's (MCD), Lowe\u2019s (LOW), Ford (F), Tractor Supply (TSCO), and John Deere (DE). The latest reversal came Friday when retailer Target (TGT) said it would end its three-year diversity, equity, and inclusion goals.\n\nMany of these retreats were also influenced by a recent US Supreme Court decision on affirmative action at colleges and universities, a ruling that prompted some conservative groups to ramp up their efforts to eliminate diverse hiring practices.\n\nBut Costco is not the only company defending its diversity stance. Another is Apple (AAPL), which has also asked investors to vote down a shareholder proposal from the NCPPR encouraging the iPhone maker to assess risks of its DEI programs. That vote will take place next month.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\"Apple is an equal opportunity employer and does not discriminate in recruiting, hiring, training, or promoting on any basis protected by law,\" the company said in its proxy statement.\n\nSome big banks are also holding firm, for now. The CEOs of JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) this past week also said they will focus on efforts to promote DEI even as those banks are emerging as targets of activist groups pushing them to trim their DEI efforts, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal.Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo\u00b7REUTERS / Reuters\n\nTexas Attorney General Ken Paxton and nine other Republican-controlled states sent a letter to JPMorgan, Goldman, and other big Wall Street firms asking them to respond to questions about their DEI programs, hinting at a possible legal clash to come.\n\n\"Bring them on,\" Dimon said about activist efforts targeting DEI during an interview with CNBC last week in Davos.\n\n\"We are going to continue to reach out to the Black community, the Hispanic community, the LGBT community, the veterans community.\"\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

The upcoming vote on the shareholder proposal regarding DEI at Apple may also indicate a strong backing from investors, which could bolster confidence in the stock.

The article highlights that Apple is defending its DEI stance. This could be viewed as a positive signal by investors who value DEI, but also a potential risk factor given the political climate and potential backlash. The article doesn't provide any specific new information about Apple's financial performance or strategic direction beyond its DEI stance. Given the mixed signals and the broader context of the article, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be neutral to slightly positive. The fact that Apple is standing by its DEI policies could attract investors who value such initiatives, but the potential for backlash and political scrutiny could temper any significant upward movement.

A call with CEO Tim Cook and CFO Kevan Parekh is set for 5:00PM ET.\n\nThe expected move in the options market is about 4.6% up or down. Shares fell 3.1% after the company\u2019s fiscal Q4 report came out in late October.\n\nSource: InvestingPro\n\nUnderscoring several near-term headwinds Apple faces amid the current climate, 11 out of 17 analysts surveyed by InvestingPro lowered their revenue forecasts in the last 90 days.\n\nWhile the company is expected to post EPS of $2.35 on revenue of $124.09 billion for its most recent quarter, signs of waning iPhone demand\u2014particularly in China\u2014are raising concerns about Apple\u2019s growth trajectory.\n\nAnalysts are also worried about Apple\u2019s slower adoption and commercialization of AI, which could weigh on future product innovation.\n\nAdding to the uncertainty, Apple\u2019s guidance for the current quarter is anticipated to disappoint, with Wall Street bracing for muted sales and earnings growth.\n\nSource: Investing.com\n\nAAPL stock closed at $228.78 on Friday, not far from a recent four-month low of $219.38 touched on January 21. Shares, which are testing their 200-day moving average, are down a whopping 11% to start the new year.\n\nAt its current valuation, Apple has a market cap of $3.35 trillion, making it the second-most valuable company on the U.S. stock exchange after Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nIt is worth mentioning that despite its relative underperformance, AAPL remains extremely overvalued as per the Fair Value models on InvestingPro, which point to a potential downside of -15.5% to about $188/share.\n\nFurthermore, Apple currently has an InvestingPro Financial Health score of 2.6/5, emphasizing its slowing profit and sales growth.

While it highlights concerns about slowing iPhone sales, reduced innovation momentum, and negative analyst revisions, it also notes that Apple's earnings report is highly anticipated and could cause a significant price swing.  The article emphasizes the potential for a 4.6% move in either direction based on options market expectations.  The article's recommendation to sell Apple is based on these negative factors and an InvestingPro valuation suggesting a potential 15.5% downside. However, the article itself acknowledges the potential for significant price movement in either direction following the earnings report.  Given the uncertainty and the potential for positive surprises, assigning a precise probability is difficult.  The probability of a price rise is weighted lower due to the prevailing negative sentiment and analyst concerns, but the potential for a positive surprise from earnings cannot be ignored."

        "headline": "Warren Buffett Has $69.9 Billion Invested in This Dividend-Paying Stock. Is It a Buy Now?",
        "content": "There are many ways to get rich on Wall Street, but none seem as reliable as the strategies employed by Warren Buffett. The legendary investor took control of Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) in 1965. Over the past six decades, the stock has delivered a 19.6% average annual gain.\n\nThere aren't any secrets to Buffett's success. In addition to an annual shareholder meeting that can pack a stadium full of investors, Berkshire Hathaway reports its trading activity to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission every three months.\n\nWe can see from Berkshire's disclosures that it ended last September with 300 million Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) shares in its portfolio. Worth $69.9 billion at the time, the iPhone manufacturer made up 26% of the holding company's equity portfolio.\n\nApple is Berkshire Hathaway's largest holding, but it's a much smaller holding than it used to be. Berkshire reduced the number of Apple shares on its books by 25% in the third quarter of 2024, and it wasn't the first sale. Berkshire has reduced the size of its Apple stake by 66.5% since the end of 2022.\n\nWhy Buffett sold heaps of Apple shares\n\nBuffett wouldn't keep Apple at the top of Berkshire's portfolio if he weren't confident about the business and its ability to steadily grow earnings over time. That said, selling off more than half of its stake is hardly an inspiring vote of confidence.\n\nBerkshire's recent sales of Apple stock have more to do with the stock's stretched valuation than any concern about the business. The stock is trading for about 31.7 times trailing free cash flow. That's an appropriate price for a business with profits growing by a mid- to high-single-digit percentage, which is not an accurate description of Apple's performance in recent years.AAPL Free Cash Flow data by YCharts.\n\nTrailing-12-month revenue has risen by 1.3% over the past three years. Apple's bottom line has outpaced its top line, but not by much. Free cash flow per share has risen 10.7% over the past three years and has been creeping higher, but only because Apple is repurchasing heaps of its own stock. Total free cash flow has risen only 2.9% over the past three years.\n\nA mismatch between Apple's valuation and its recent performance puts it in a precarious situation. If the market finds a reason to get nervous about its yearslong earnings deceleration, the bottom could fall out from under the stock.\n\nWhy holding some Apple shares is still a good idea\n\nInvestors can think of free cash flow as earnings a company can use to pay dividends, reinvest, reduce debt, or repurchase stock. With $108.8 billion in free cash flow over the past 12 months, Apple can pull on a lot of different levers to keep earnings per share moving in the right direction over the long run.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple's device sales aren't growing very fast, but it is selling a growing array of services to its enormous user base. Last year, the company reported more than 2.2 billion active devices worldwide, and high-margin service sales to all those device holders are picking up.\n\nFiscal fourth-quarter service sales rose 12% year over year. Now, services are responsible for 26% of total revenue.\u00a0While device sales will likely creep forward due to market saturation, plenty of those device holders haven't started subscriptions to iCloud Storage, Apple Music, or Apple TV+ yet. High-margin service sales could allow earnings to continue growing at a single-digit percentage for many years.\n\nThe bottom could fall out from under Apple's stock price the next time the stock market gets sad. Fortunately, it will take more than a bear market to slow Apple's steadily growing dividend payments. The stock offers a minuscule 0.4% dividend yield at recent prices, but it could safely raise it by leaps and bounds. Over the past 12 months, the company met its dividend commitment with just 14% of the free cash flow its operations generated.\n\nNot time to buy\n\nApple is still the largest holding in Berkshire's equity portfolio, but that doesn't make it a good stock to buy now for most investors. There are plenty of good reasons to retain some shares of Apple in a well-diversified portfolio. Unfortunately, buying the richly valued stock while sales and profits appear nearly stagnant doesn't seem like a great idea.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

On the other hand, Apple's strong free cash flow, growing services segment, and potential for dividend increases provide some positive outlook. The reduction by a major investor like Berkshire could lead to negative sentiment, but Apple's fundamentals and market position may cushion the impact.

Powell's press conference, slated to start at 2:30 p.m. ET, is likely the larger source of market volatility.\n\nThis past Thursday, Trump said in a virtual appearance at the World Economic Forum in Davos that with oil prices going down he'd \"demand that interest rates drop immediately.\" These comments stirred discussion about a potential clash with the Federal Reserve.\n\nEven so, the press conference may be less exciting than normal, according to JPMorgan chief US economist Michael Feroli. \"Powell\u2019s post-meeting press conference has often stolen the show on FOMC day in recent years,\" Feroli wrote.\n\n\"For next week, however, we expect he will adopt more of a 'duck and cover' approach. In particular, we anticipate he will indicate that each Committee participant is using their own conditioning assumptions on what trade policies are ultimately adopted, and that the only thing decided at the meeting was the monetary policy statement agreed to next Wednesday\"President Donald Trump (L) and Federal Reserve Governor Jerome Powell at a nomination ceremony at the White House in Washington D.C., in 2017. (Xinhua/Yin Bogu via Getty Images)\u00b7Xinhua News Agency via Getty Images\n\nEconomic health check\n\nSeveral key readings on the health of the US economy are also due out throughout the week.\n\nOn Thursday, the first estimate of fourth quarter GDP is expected to show the US economy grew at an annualized pace of 2.6% in the final three months of 2024, below the 3.1% pace seen in the prior quarter.\n\nFriday will feature a fresh reading of the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the Personal Consumption Expenditures index, with economists expecting annual \"core\" PCE \u2014 which excludes the volatile categories of food and energy \u2014 to have clocked in at 2.8% in December, unchanged from November. Over the prior month, economists project \"core\" PCE inflation rose 0.2%, faster than the 0.1% seen in November.\n\nRBC Capital Markets head of US rate strategy Blake Gwinn wrote in a note to clients on Friday that the data dump at the end of the week \u2014 combined with Trump's policies \u2014 could leave the Fed \"playing third fiddle\" in markets.\n\nGwinn argued either commentary from Trump or the looming data could \"quickly render stale anything Powell says at next week\u2019s press conference.\"\n\nBig Tech on deck\n\nS&P 500 companies have had a strong start to earnings season. The index is expected to grow earnings by 12.7% compared to the year prior in the fourth quarter, per FactSet data.\n\nBut much of that growth still relies on the performance of the \"Magnificent Seven\" tech stocks. And four of those companies \u2014 Tesla, Meta, Microsoft, and Apple \u2014 will report in the week ahead.\n\nThis group of seven tech stocks is expected to grow earnings by 21.7% in the fourth quarter compared to the 9.7% earnings growth projected for the other 493 tech stocks.\n\nAs the chart below shows, this earnings growth gap is expected to narrow throughout 2025, prompting many equity strategists to call for a broadening of the stock market rally outside of large-cap tech.\n\nThough as Venu Krishna, head of US equity strategy at Barclays, pointed out in his 2025 outlook, given the large earnings growth expected for Big Tech throughout the year, the group is \"likely to remain as critical of an EPS growth driver for the S&P 500 as the group was [in 2024].\"\n\nNotably, earnings growth for the Magnificent Seven is expected to reaccelerate in the second half of the year after a moderate slowdown in the year's first six months.\n\nWeekly Calendar\n\nMonday\n\nEconomic data: Chicago Fed National Activity Index, December (-0.12 previously); New home sales, month-over-month, December (+6.6% expected, +5.9% previously)\n\nEarnings: AT&T (T), Nucor (NUE), SoFi (SOFI), Western Alliance Bancorporation (WAL)\n\nTuesday\n\nEconomic data: Durable goods orders, December (+0.8% expected, -1.2% previously); FHFA house price index, month-over-month, November (+0.4% previously), S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller home prices, 20-city index, month-over-month seasonally adjusted, November (+0.3% expected, +0.32% previously); Conference Board Consumer Confidence, January (105.6 expected, 104.7 previously); Richmond Fed manufacturing index, January (-10 previously)\n\nEarnings: Boeing (BA), General Motors (GM), JetBlue (JBLU), Lockheed Martin (LMT), Logitech (LOGI), Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL), SAP (SAP), Starbucks (SBUX), Sysco (SYY)\n\nWednesday\n\nEconomic data: MBA Mortgage Applications, week ended Jan. 24 (+0.1% previously); FOMC rate decision (no change expected)\n\nEarnings: Tesla (TSLA), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), ADP (ADP), ASML (ASML), General Dynamics (GD), IBM (IBM), Nasdaq (NDAQ), Progressive (PGR), ServiceNow (NOW), T-Mobile (TMUS), V.F.

The overall market sentiment appears positive, driven by a rally in tech stocks and a favorable economic environment with expectations of steady interest rates from the Federal Reserve. Additionally, the anticipated earnings growth for Apple aligns with the broader positive outlook for the tech sector. However, potential volatility from the Fed's press conference and economic data releases could introduce uncertainty. Given these factors, the probability of Apple's stock price rising is higher than that of it falling."

The Fed meeting and Powell's comments could introduce volatility. Additionally, economic data releases (GDP and PCE) could influence market sentiment. The article also mentions that the market's focus on Trump's policies will be tested. Given these factors, I believe there's a slightly higher probability of a stock price rise, but the situation is uncertain."

Positive factors include the overall strong market performance fueled by Trump's policies (less focus on tariffs, AI investment boost), and the expectation of strong Q4 earnings for Apple and the tech sector as a whole.  However, counterbalancing this is the upcoming Fed meeting, where Powell's comments on interest rates and future policy could negatively impact the market, including tech stocks.  The overall economic data releases (GDP, inflation) also carry uncertainty, potentially overshadowing Apple's earnings.  Given the strong recent market performance and the generally positive sentiment towards tech, the probability of a price rise is slightly higher, but the uncertainty surrounding the Fed and economic data prevents a definitive prediction."

However, potential risks include any negative surprises in Apple's earnings or guidance, and broader market reactions to economic data or Fed commentary. Overall, the positive factors seem to outweigh the risks."

        "content": "Investing.com -- Here is your Pro Recap of the top takeaways from Wall Street analysts for the past week.\n\nInvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analyst comments. Upgrade today!\n\nMonday- US Markets Closed for Martin Luther King Jr. Day\n\nApple\n\nWhat happened? On Tuesday, Jefferies downgraded Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) to Underperform with a $200.75 price target.\n\n*TLDR: Jefferies downgrades Apple on weak iPhone sales. AI outlook and growth targets missed.\n\nWhat\u2019s the full story? Jefferies lowers forecasts due to weak iPhone sales and the general consumer electronics market, citing a reduced outlook for iPhone 17/18 due to slower AI uptake and commercialization.\n\nJefferies expects Apple to miss its revenue growth guidance of 5% for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 and to guide to only low single-digit revenue growth in the second quarter, also below consensus.\n\nThe AI outlook remains subdued, with industry checks suggesting delays in Apple's advanced packaging roadmap for iPhone as another negative sign. Jefferies' new price target implies a 13% downside, leading to this downgrade.\n\nFord\n\nWhat happened? On Wednesday, Barclays (LON:BARC) downgraded Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) to Equal-weight with an $11 price target.\n\n*TLDR: Barclays downgrades Ford due to 2025 headwinds. Uncertain cost improvement paths expected.\n\nWhat\u2019s the full story? Barclays analysts acknowledge Ford's ongoing transformation efforts, but anticipate significant volume headwinds in 2025, driven by inventory destocking and modest price normalization, which may negatively impact earnings estimates.\n\nWhile cost reduction has potential, with opportunities to narrow the cost gap compared to competitors, Barclays highlights the uncertainty surrounding the path to cost improvement. The Tier 1 desk's 2025 EPS estimate of $1.44 falls below Bloomberg's consensus of $1.63, reflecting their cautious outlook on Ford's earnings profile.\n\nVeeva Systems\n\nWhat happened? On Thursday, Goldman Sachs double downgraded Veeva Systems Inc (NYSE:VEEV) (NYSE:VEEV) to Sell with a $261 price target.\n\n*TLDR: Goldman views Veeva as entrenched but faces competition and slow recovery. Veeva's underperformance expected relative to other coverage.\n\nWhat\u2019s the full story? Goldman continues to view Veeva as deeply entrenched in its core Life Sciences customer base, with significant cross-selling potential over the next decade. However, the global investment bank identifies several medium-term risks to Veeva\u2019s 2030 targets. These include competition from Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) in the Commercial sector, which is expected to be a persistent headwind, and a slow fundamental recovery in the Life Sciences vertical, likely to impact customer expansion and renewal deals.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAdditionally, Veeva\u2019s maturing product portfolio may pose challenges for newer product cycles to drive substantial growth.\n\nGoldman projects that Veeva will underperform relative to other coverage over the next 12 months, despite limited absolute downside risk given its free cash flow support and multiple quarters of underperformance. The bank is more cautious on medium-term fundamentals, and its revised price target implies a 13% downside risk compared to an average 11% upside for its Buy and Neutral-rated names.\n\nTwilio\n\nWhat happened? On Friday, Baird upgraded Twilio Inc (NYSE:TWLO) to Outperform with a $160 price target.\n\n*TLDR: Baird bullish on TWLO's revenue and valuation. Profitability, gains, and capital returns expected to rise.\n\nWhat\u2019s the full story? Thursday, Baird attended TWLO's investor day, buoyed by a pre-released Q4 upside and broad-based strength. The brokerage emerged more confident in TWLO's capacity to sustain double-digit revenue growth, anticipating further upside to guidance and estimates.\n\nAcknowledging recent gains they had been cautious to chase, Baird now expects a potential beat-and-raise pattern to drive shares higher, especially with improving profitability, cash flow, and capital returns. Valuation is still deemed reasonable, particularly given possible upside scenarios.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nStreet Calls of the Week\n\n5 big analyst AI moves: Apple stock faces downgrades; New Street-high PT for Tesla\n\nAnalyst lists 10 key questions for the power sector in 2025\n\nView Comments",

However, the headline also poses the question of whether it's *still* a buy, implying that the market may have already priced in Buffett's investment to some extent. Therefore, while a rise is more likely, a significant jump is less probable. The dividend aspect is a minor positive, contributing to the overall attractiveness of the stock, but the primary driver is Buffett's endorsement. Given the maturity of Apple as a company, and the widespread knowledge of Buffett's position, the impact is likely to be moderate."

Given that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a well-known dividend-paying stock and a significant holding for many major investors, there's a positive sentiment that could be inferred from Buffett's investment. However, the news does not exclusively mention Apple Inc., which is crucial for a direct impact assessment. Assuming the stock in question is Apple, the news could lead to increased investor confidence and potentially drive the stock price up. But without explicit confirmation that the stock is AAPL, the impact might be muted. Therefore, there's a higher probability of the stock price rising due to the positive sentiment associated with Warren Buffett's investment strategy, but the lack of direct confirmation introduces some uncertainty."

The fact that he has $69.9 billion invested in Apple suggests that he has confidence in the company's long-term prospects. This could lead to increased investor confidence and potentially drive up the stock price. Additionally, the article highlights that Apple is a dividend-paying stock, which can attract income-seeking investors. However, it's also possible that the market has already factored in Buffett's investment, and the news may not have a significant impact on the stock price. Nevertheless, given Buffett's reputation and the positive sentiment surrounding his investments, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling."

        "headline": "Apple Receives Rare Underperform Rating from Wall Street Analyst. Is It Time to Sell the Stock?",
        "content": "In a rare move, analysts at Jefferies downgraded one of the largest companies in the world, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), to underperform. Wall Street analysts are known for being bullish, so underperform and sell ratings tend to make up only a small percentage of overall analyst ratings.\n\nFor its part, Jefferies sees weak iPhone shipments in the fourth quarter, with Apple's artificial intelligence (AI) features not resonating with consumers. It cited a survey that most U.S. consumers do not find AI features very useful. As such, it thinks this is an indication that there will not be an AI power upgrade cycle for the iPhone.\n\nJefferies expects Apple to miss current analyst revenue estimates, calling for 5% growth when it reports its Q4 results at the end of January. It also thinks there is a good possibility Apple's Q1 guidance could disappoint as well. Its price target for the stock is $200.75.\n\nGiven the rare underperform rating, many investors may be wondering if it's time to sell the stock.\n\nA strong business model\n\nDespite the downgrade related to iPhone sales projections, one thing has not changed: Apple has a strong business model. The company's revenue growth was pretty lackluster throughout its fiscal 2024 ended in September. It only grew its revenue 2% on the year and 6% for its fiscal Q4. Revenue growth for its devices, meanwhile, has been even worse. Product revenue actually fell by 1% for its fiscal year, while rising by 4% last fiscal quarter.\n\nWhere Apple has seen stronger growth is in its high-margin services revenue. This includes revenue from its App Store, search-sharing revenue, Apple TV, Apple Pay, and other subscriptions and services. Last fiscal year, its services revenue climbed 13% and was up 12% in Q4.\n\nIts services gross margin is close to 74%, while its product gross margin is about 37%. With the services margin nearly double, revenue coming from services more easily drops to bottom-line profits. As such, the company was able to grow its adjusted earnings per share by 11% last year to $6.75, despite only a 2% increase in revenue.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nRight now, it appears that the big iPhone upgrade cycle related to Apple Intelligence is not materializing. The company has had some issues with its offering, such as its AI producing inaccurate news alerts. Meanwhile, both iPhone and Android smartphone users in surveys have indicated that that AI features are adding little to no value. Then there is the whole question of whether users will eventually pay for AI subscription services. Right now for Apple, AI seems to be more of a cost without any offsetting revenue benefit.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe company also hasn't been able to include Apple Intelligence with its smartphones in China. It had already been struggling in the country against local competitors, and according to Counterpoint Research, iPhone sales plunged in China by 18% in Q4. Sales of smartphones from rival Huawei, meanwhile, climbed 15.5% in the quarter.\n\nApple initially saw strong iPhone sales in China after it debuted its latest version. However, its AI is not approved in China and it must find a local AI partner to incorporate its technology to run Apple Intelligence in China. Apple mostly competes in the premium smartphone market in China, so the lack of the latest AI technology has left it behind competitors.\n\nOutside of smartphone sales, Apple also faces another big risk related the Alphabet antitrust case. Alphabet has been paying Apple an estimated $20 billion a year as part of its revenue-sharing model for Google to be the default search engine for its browser Safari. This revenue is also virtually pure margin, dropping right to operating income. With Alphabet losing its antitrust case and this agreement in jeopardy, the impact it eventually could have on this revenue stream is still very much in the air as the case could lead to some pretty big changes. However, any impact is likely years away as the ruling gets appealed and both companies have reason to try to protect what is currently in place.\n\nExpanding valuation\n\nApple stock has seen a lot of multiple expansion in the past several years. Its trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio has essentially tripled from 12 times to 36 times, while its forward P/E based on current fiscal year estimates is around 30 times.AAPL PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts\n\nSome of this multiple expansion can be attributed to the shift toward high-margin services revenue, as these businesses tend to carry higher multiples than hardware businesses. Apple has also proven to be a steady business that tends to have a somewhat predictable, albeit lengthening, replacement cycle.\n\nThat said, with the hope of an iPhone upgrade cycle diminishing and the stock seeing a lot of multiple expansion in the past six years, I think it would be smart to take some profits on the stock.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

                "reasoning": "The downgrade to an underperform rating by Jefferies, along with concerns about weak iPhone shipments and the lack of consumer interest in AI features, suggests a bearish outlook for Apple. The potential for missed revenue estimates and disappointing guidance further supports this negative sentiment. While Apple has a strong business model and growth in services revenue, the immediate impact of the downgrade and the challenges in the smartphone market, particularly in China, indicate a higher likelihood of stock price decline.

                "reasoning": "The news presents a mixed picture for Apple. The rare 'underperform' rating from Jefferies is a significant negative signal, especially given the analyst's concerns about weak iPhone shipments, lack of AI resonance, and potential revenue and guidance misses. The price target of $200.75 also suggests downside. However, Apple's strong business model, particularly its high-margin services revenue, provides a buffer. The potential loss of revenue from the Alphabet antitrust case is a long-term risk. The high P/E ratio suggests the stock may be overvalued. The negative sentiment surrounding AI features and challenges in China further weigh on the stock. Considering these factors, the probability of a stock price fall is higher than a rise in the short term. However, Apple's overall strength and potential for future innovation prevent a very high probability of a fall."

                "reasoning": "The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While a rare underperform rating from Jefferies and concerns about weak iPhone shipments and AI feature adoption suggest potential downside, several counterpoints exist. Apple's strong services revenue growth, high margins, and overall robust business model offer resilience.  The concerns about AI integration in China and the Alphabet antitrust case are long-term risks, not immediate threats. The current high P/E ratio suggests the stock might be overvalued, supporting the analyst's price target of $200.75.  Considering these factors, the probability of a price fall is higher than a price rise in the short term, but the long-term outlook remains relatively positive due to the strength of Apple's services business and overall brand power. The probability estimates are subjective and based on the information provided, acknowledging the inherent uncertainty in stock market predictions."

Given the rarity of such downgrades and the immediate negative sentiment, the stock is more likely to face downward pressure in the short term."

        "content": "Apple Stock Nears Critical Level Amid Worst Start To The Year Since 2008: 'When You Get Names Starting To Flirt With It...You Kind Of Lose Confidence'\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has had a turbulent beginning to 2025, with its shares approaching a significant level that could signal further losses if breached, according to analysts.\n\nWhat Happened: Since the start of the year, the tech behemoth\u2019s stock has plummeted by 11%, making it the weakest\u00a0performer in the \u2018Magnificent 7\u2019\u00a0group. This downturn is in stark contrast to the S&P 500, which has seen a 4% gain, reaching a new record high.\n\nDon\u2019t Miss:\n\n\u2018Scrolling To UBI' \u2014 Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones. You can invest today for just $0.26/share with a $1000 minimum. If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?\n\nApple is experiencing its most challenging beginning of the year since 2008. The stock\u2019s drop has brought it near the 200-day moving average, a critical technical indicator seen by many traders as a long-term support level.\n\n\u201cWhen\u00a0you get names starting to\u00a0flirt with it or start\u00a0to break below it, you\u00a0kind of lose confidence that\u00a0the uptrend of that name\u00a0is still intact,\u201d Todd Sohn, an ETF\u00a0and technical strategist at Strategas\u00a0Securities LLC, told Bloomberg.\n\nWhy It Matters: Apple\u2019s position is now precarious. Until recently, it was the world's most valuable company and had the largest weighting in the S&P 500 Index. However, amid its decline, Nvidia has now overtaken Apple in market value.\n\nDespite Apple\u2019s selloff, the S&P 500 has continued to rally. However, if other major tech stocks start to decline, it could signal trouble for the bull market, now in its third year. \"It definitely has the potential to create some more risk for those major indices. If we see that downside follow-through that we're anticipating, that makes it more challenging, of course, for those indices to shrug it off,\" said Katie Stockton, managing partner and founder of Fairlead Strategies LLC.\n\nTrending: Coinbase\u2019s latest promo gets you up to $200 in crypto (Seriously!) \u2014 Here's everything you need to know to take advantage of this offer.\n\nApple is scheduled to release its quarterly earnings on January 30, after market close, an event that investors are closely watching.\u00a0Despite the stock\u2019s current performance, analysts remain optimistic about Apple\u2019s future. Laura Martin, an analyst at Needham, believes that Apple\u2019s dependence on the iPhone remains, but services and wearables offer growth potential. Additionally, Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America Securities predicts that Apple\u2019s Q1 earnings might not miss a beat, despite a softer iPhone cycle.\n\nStory Continues\n\nEarlier this week, President Donald Trump announced that Apple was planning a \u201cmassive investment\u201d in the United States. This was part of Trump\u2019s initiative to accelerate major corporate investments in the U.S.\n\nPrice Action: Apple shares ended 0.39% lower on Friday. Year-to-date the company\u2019s shares lost 8.64%, as reported by Benzinga Pro.\n\nCheck It Out:\n\nInterest Rates Are Falling, But These Yields Aren't Going Anywhere\n\nLower interest rates mean some investments won't yield what they did in months past, but you don't have to lose those gains. Certain private market real estate investments are giving retail investors the opportunity to capitalize on these high-yield opportunities.\n\nArrived Home's Private Credit Fund\u2019s has historically paid an annualized dividend yield of 8.1%*, which provides access to a pool of short-term loans backed by residential real estate.

The loss of market value leadership to Nvidia further contributes to the negative sentiment. While some analysts remain optimistic about Apple's long-term prospects and Trump announced a 'massive investment', the immediate impact of the negative trends and the upcoming earnings report create more uncertainty. The fact that the stock ended down on Friday despite the Trump announcement suggests the negative sentiment is currently stronger.

The upcoming earnings report is a major catalyst, but until then, the negative momentum is likely to persist. Therefore, the probability of a fall is higher than a rise in the short term."

For example, economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal have adjusted their forecasts, anticipating higher inflation and interest rates in the coming years. They note that inflation has been higher than expected, with the consumer-price index rising 2.9% in December, leading to projections of continued inflation momentum into 2025. Despite these concerns, the US economy has demonstrated resilience, driven by strong consumer spending and a declining unemployment rate, which fell to 4.1% in December. Consequently, economists estimate a 22% chance of a recession in the next 12 months, marking the lowest probability in three years.\n\nJeremy Siegel, a renowned economist from the Wharton School, suggests that the stock market could experience a cooling-off period in 2025, particularly within the technology sector, amid concerns over the rapid adoption of artificial intelligence. He also anticipates that interest rates might decline, which could influence market dynamics. Additionally, MarketWatch reports that foreign retail investors have been purchasing US stocks at unprecedented rates, with $76.5 billion acquired in the last three months. Historically, such surges in foreign investment have preceded market downturns, as observed before the 1987 crash, the 2000 dot-com bubble burst, and the 2008 financial crisis. This pattern suggests that increased foreign investment may serve as a contrary indicator, signaling potential market peaks.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nSeveral economic experts also predict a bear market in 2025. For example, Cem Karsan, a volatility trader and founder of Kai Volatility, foresees a possible stock market decline of up to 40% within the next year, per a report by MarketWatch. He emphasizes that the Federal Reserve\u2019s management of rate cuts and market expectations will be crucial. Karsan predicts that the 10-year Treasury yield could surpass 6% by the third quarter, which would exert additional pressure on stocks. He suggests that the Fed\u2019s approach can either delay or accelerate the decline; a dovish stance might prolong the market rally but lead to a harder drop, whereas a hawkish stance could cause an earlier slide.\n\nStory Continues\n\nSimilarly, Paul Krugman, a Nobel laureate and economist, has raised concerns that aggressive policy measures, such as imposing tariffs on China, could lead to inflation spikes and trade wars, potentially destabilizing the economy. He warns that such policies might exacerbate inflation and pressure the US labor market, contributing to economic instability. While these experts highlight potential risks, it\u2019s important to note that market predictions are inherently uncertain. Other analysts maintain a more optimistic outlook for 2025. For instance, JP Morgan Research anticipates robust global economic growth, with the exception of a slowdown in China, and projects a price target of 6,500 for the S&P 500, with earnings per share of $270.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nOur list of the best bear market stocks to buy is grounded in hedge fund sentiment towards each stock.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. This company emerges as a prime investment opportunity for several reasons. First and foremost, the company\u2019s robust financial health is depicted in the report for the fourth quarter of 2024. For instance, the total revenue was $94.9 billion, increasing 6% year over year, and quarterly diluted earnings per share was $0.97. This shows the increasing demand for the company\u2019s products or services and its ability to generate earnings for shareholders. Moreover, the company has a consistent record of returning value to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase programs. In fiscal 2024, the company declared quarterly dividends of $0.24 per share, totaling $0.96 per share annually. Secondly, the company has also introduced a general health-monitoring tool in all its new devices. For instance, an Apple Watch can monitor heart rate, check for atrial fibrillation, detect falls and car crashes, monitor blood-oxygen levels, and track body temperature for fertility planning.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of best bear market stocks to invest in now.

        "headline": "BT urges competition crackdown to block Apple\u2019s stranglehold on smartphones",
        "content": "BT van\n\nBT has called for a competition crackdown on Apple over concerns the tech giant could use its smartphone market power to squeeze out mobile networks.\n\nThe operator has raised concerns that the rise of virtual \u201ceSims\u201d that replace Sim cards could see smartphone makers tighten their grip on the market.\n\nIn a submission to the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), BT said: \u201cWe also encourage the CMA to consider the risk of disintermediation in the telecoms industry with respect to eSims, which is an additional area where handset providers could exercise their strong market position.\u201d\n\nPhysical Sim cards have long been a critical link between network operators and their customers. But the growth of eSims means BT and its rivals risk losing ground to the likes of Apple and Samsung, who are increasingly selling phones directly to consumers.\n\nThe threat is particularly acute as telecoms companies try to expand their offering beyond traditional mobile services, amid tough competition and shrinking margins.\n\nBT, which is side-lining its brand in favour of EE, has outlined plans to start selling other products and services from fridges to insurance. It has also launched a new service and smartphone app, dubbed EE ID, in a bid to expand its customer base.\n\nHowever, industry executives fear these efforts could be undermined as tech companies increasingly build a direct relationship with their customers.\n\nKester Mann, of industry analyst CCS Insight, said: \u201cOne of the challenges is that network provisioning starts to become more remote, therefore there\u2019s less opportunity for operators to engage with customers, whether that\u2019s selling new products or getting a sense check on how they\u2019re feeling.\n\n\u201cIt feels like it\u2019s another part of the journey that is cutting operators out the loop a little bit, so I think that\u2019s one of the reasons why they\u2019ve been a little bit reluctant to embrace the eSim concept.\u201d\n\nIn the most extreme scenario, companies such as Apple could use eSims to launch their own virtual mobile networks \u2013 similar to the likes of GiffGaff and Tesco Mobile \u2013 though analysts said this was unlikely in the near term.\n\neSims were not mentioned in an investigation into Apple and Google launched by the CMA last week, which focused on web browsers and smartphone app stores.\n\nApple introduced its first eSim iPhone in 2022 and all of its US devices are now eSim only, with a similar move expected in Europe as soon as this year.\n\nBT is not alone in sounding the alarm over the rise of eSims. Virgin Media O2 has also raised concerns about tech giants tightening their grip on mobile markets.\n\nStory Continues\n\nIn a separate Ofcom submission published in 2022, the company said: \u201cIncreased competition may deliver short-term benefits to consumers of mobile services, but there are genuine concerns around the potential ability of big tech to leverage their strong position in the supply of operating systems and their control over their vertically integrated ecosystems in a way that undermines competition and delivery of good outcomes in mobile markets in the long run.\u201d\n\nVodafone also has a team of people working to address concerns about the strength of big tech. However, industry sources cautioned that operators had lucrative partnerships with tech companies and were keen to maintain good relations.\n\nApple did not comment on the BT submission.\n\nIn response to last week\u2019s CMA investigation it said: \u201cApple believes in thriving and dynamic markets where innovation can flourish. We face competition in every segment and jurisdiction where we operate, and our focus is always the trust of our users.\n\n\u201cIn the UK alone, the iOS app economy supports hundreds of thousands of jobs and makes it possible for developers big and small to reach users on a trusted platform.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to engage constructively with the CMA as their work on this matter progresses.\u201d\n\nView Comments",

        "headline": "Streaming turned profits in 2024. Wall Street's biggest worry is whether momentum can last.",
        "content": "For years, the world's biggest media companies struggled to make money off of their streaming services. The culprits: pricey content, user churn, and lots of competition.\n\nIn 2024, that finally changed.\n\nThe five giants \u2014 Netflix (NFLX), Disney (DIS), Paramount (PARA), NBCUniversal's Peacock (CMCSA), and Warner Bros. Discovery's Max (WBD) \u2014 collectively reported a profit in the first nine months of the year for the very first time. In total, those five companies delivered earnings of roughly $5.9 billion, significantly ahead of the $142 million loss the group reported in the year-ago period.\n\nNetflix led the charge, pulling in roughly $6.9 billion in earnings in the first three quarters. (Wall Street declared the company the unofficial winner of the streaming wars.) But there's more: Earlier this week the company reported an additional $1.87 billion in profits to end the fourth quarter \u2014 and nearly 20 million more subscribers.\n\nThe other four media giants will report fourth quarter results later this month and next, with Comcast first up on Jan. 30. A big question for investors is whether or not traditional players can successfully follow the leader.\n\nLast year delivered some early answers. Disney and Paramount Global each reported their first quarter of streaming profits in August. Also, Peacock significantly narrowed year-over-year losses, while WBD's streaming profits ended the year on positive footing.\n\nMacquarie analyst Tim Nollen categorized the improvements as \"progress,\" but cautioned that even the streamers who have hit profitability don't have enough profits to generate significant margins. Most, with the obvious exception of Netflix, have hit just around breakeven.\n\nFor Morningstar analyst Matthew Dolgin, the key to success is \"the pace of revenue growth.\" He added, \"To me, profits are a lot about scale. ... So if you can increase scale, which we saw some benefits from this past year, then you can maintain profitability.\"\n\nFor traditional media companies, he continued, being profitable isn't enough. \"Because they have terrible linear businesses that continue to decline, they need streaming to be more than just profitable. They need streaming to produce fast-growing profits.\"\n\nWhat lies ahead\n\nThe \"streaming wars,\" which unofficially kicked off in November 2019 following the launch of Disney's flagship streaming platform, set off an accelerated race for content, talent, and subscribers. That led to an era of overspending as platforms, both new and established, raced to lure top producers and secure the most sought-after shows.\n\nStory Continues\n\nBut investors quickly realized that it's difficult to monetize users, justify the high cost of content, keep subscribers engaged, and turn a profit. One of the biggest reasons: streaming's low price point. With the exception of cable replacement services like YouTube TV and Hulu + Live TV, prices can range anywhere from $4.99 a month to $22.99.\n\nThat low cost means more subscribers are needed to generate significant returns. Lourdes Balduque via Getty Images\n\nIn response to investors' growing profit fears, companies adjusted their strategies and were eventually able to attract more subscribers through controversial password-sharing crackdowns and multi-tier subscription offerings, in addition to more strategic content acquisitions and the return of key original programming.\n\nCompanies also shifted how aggressively they spend their money. Instead of ballooning content budgets and releasing as many shows as possible, streamers pulled back to focus on more quality over quantity projects.\n\n\"Everything was kind of messy for a few years,\" Macquarie's Nollen said. \"Streamers are finally getting the revenue and cost lines to balance out. But it's questionable how profitable these services can be.\"\n\n(edited)\n\nOne obstacle to achieving consistent profits is combating increased churn in the face of higher prices. (Netflix became the latest platform to boost subscription costs in the US, bumping the prices of its various tiers earlier this week.)\n\n\"The bigger risk is really retaining the customer base and figuring out whether we get to a threshold where there are too many platforms,\" Morningstar's Dolgin said. Also, \"there's a limit\" to how much more streamers can raise prices. Simultaneously, there's a limit to how many more subscribers streamers can add.\n\n\"Somewhere, you need to get that right in order to keep profits growing at a good pace,\" he said.\n\nTo combat fickle subscribers, competing platforms are now bundling their services together. As WBD CEO David Zaslav told investors last year, \"There's more strength together.\"\n\n\"I have a difficult time envisioning a scenario where any one of these players takes Netflix's mantle,\" Dolgin said. \"So [bundling with one another] is how they close the gap. They don't do it individually. They could potentially do it as a collective.\"\n\nAnd if recent news of mass layoffs and restructurings are any indication (Case in point: CNN's digital revamp), the road to catching up to Netflix \u2014 and just basic survival in the streaming-first era \u2014 might be a bumpy one.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(NFLX)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

The article doesn't directly mention Apple's streaming service, Apple TV+, but the broader context suggests that the challenges and opportunities discussed apply to the industry as a whole.  Apple's success is less directly tied to the profitability of its streaming service compared to the companies mentioned in the article. Therefore, the impact of this news on Apple's stock price is likely to be indirect and relatively muted.  The overall market sentiment regarding streaming profitability might have a slight positive influence, but it's unlikely to be a major driver for Apple's stock price.

Netflix's strong performance and subscriber growth set a benchmark, but concerns remain about sustainability, pricing power, and subscriber retention. For AAPL, which is not a traditional media company but has a growing streaming service, the news is moderately positive. The broader industry's profitability could attract more investors to the sector, but AAPL's stock is less directly impacted compared to pure-play streaming companies. The probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher due to overall sector optimism, but the effect may be limited given AAPL's diversified business model."

        "headline": "Is There An Opportunity With Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) 20% Undervaluation?",
        "content": "Key Insights\n\nApple's estimated fair value is US$279 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity Apple's US$223 share price signals that it might be 20% undervalued Our fair value estimate is 13% higher than Apple's analyst price target of US$246\n\nToday we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.\n\nWe generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Apple\n\nThe Method\n\nWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nA DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:\n\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast\n\n2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 2034 Levered FCF ($, Millions)  US$124.1b US$130.4b US$156.7b US$178.3b US$200.4b US$217.0b US$231.3b US$243.8b US$254.9b US$265.1b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x13 Analyst x14 Analyst x5 Analyst x2 Analyst x2 Est @ 8.29% Est @ 6.59% Est @ 5.40% Est @ 4.57% Est @ 3.98% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.3%  US$115.6k US$113.3k US$126.8k US$134.5k US$140.9k US$142.2k US$141.2k US$138.7k US$135.2k US$131.0k\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\r\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$1.3t\n\nStory Continues\n\nWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.6%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.3%.\n\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2034 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$265b\u00d7 (1 + 2.6%) \u00f7 (7.3%\u2013 2.6%) = US$5.8t\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$5.8t\u00f7 ( 1 + 7.3%)10= US$2.9t\n\nThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$4.2t. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$223, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 20% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.NasdaqGS:AAPL Discounted Cash Flow January 25th 2025\n\nImportant Assumptions\n\nNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Apple as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.137. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nSWOT Analysis for Apple\n\nStrength\n\nDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.\n\nWeakness\n\nEarnings declined over the past year.\n\nDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Tech market.\n\nOpportunity\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.\n\nGood value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.\n\nThreat\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.\n\nMoving On:\n\nValuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to \"what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?\" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?

However, the article also highlights the limitations of DCF models and the importance of considering other factors. The SWOT analysis presents mixed signals: strengths in debt coverage, but weaknesses in recent earnings decline and low dividend yield. Opportunities exist in future earnings growth, but threats arise from slower growth compared to the overall American market. The article also points out risks and encourages further investigation. Considering these factors, the undervaluation and growth forecasts suggest a higher probability of a price rise, but the weaknesses and risks temper this optimism. The market's reaction will also depend on overall market sentiment and investor confidence in the DCF model's assumptions."

However, the DCF model relies on several assumptions, including future cash flow projections and discount rates, which inherently involve uncertainty.  While the analysis points towards potential upside, several caveats are mentioned: the DCF model is just one valuation metric, it doesn't account for industry cyclicality or future capital requirements, and the terminal value is highly sensitive to growth rate assumptions.  The article also highlights potential risks and weaknesses for Apple. Therefore, while the undervaluation claim is compelling, the inherent uncertainties and limitations of the DCF model, along with the acknowledged risks, prevent assigning a high probability to a price rise.  A more balanced probability distribution is warranted."

        "headline": "Warren Buffett Could Make Over $3 Billion in Dividend Income in 2025 From These 5 Stocks",
        "content": "The late Senator Everett Dirksen once reportedly said, \"A billion here, a billion there, and pretty soon you're talking about real money.\" With that quote in mind, Warren Buffett's dividend income this year will be real money.\n\nTechnically, the dividend income will belong to Berkshire Hathaway. But for many, Buffett and Berkshire are practically synonymous. And they could make over $3 billion in dividend income in 2025 from these five stocks.\n\n1. Bank of America\n\nBuffett seems to have soured somewhat on Bank of America(NYSE: BAC). He significantly reduced Berkshire's stake in the big bank last year. However, Bank of America (BofA) still contributes a lot of cash to the conglomerate's coffers.\n\nAs of Sept. 30, 2024, Berkshire owned 766,305,462 shares of BofA. With the company's forward dividend of $1.04, that translates to nearly $797 million in dividend income this year. Of course, if Buffett sells more of this stock, the amount of dividends received will be lower.\n\n2. The Coca-Cola Company\n\nThe Coca-Cola Company(NYSE: KO) is one of Buffett's \"forever stocks.\" He's held it the longest of any other stock in Berkshire's portfolio. In his 2022 letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders, Buffett wrote, \"The cash dividend we received from Coke in 1994 was $75 million. By 2022, the dividend had increased to $704 million.\" That total should be even greater this year.\n\nBerkshire has owned 400 million shares of Coca-Cola for a long time. Coke pays a forward dividend of $1.94. If Buffett doesn't sell any shares (which seems to be a safe assumption), Berkshire will rake in at least $776 million in dividend income from the big food and beverage company this year. The amount will likely be higher, though. Coca-Cola is a Dividend King with 62 consecutive years of dividend increases. I fully expect the company will keep that streak going in 2025.\n\n3. Chevron\n\nChevron(NYSE: CVX) is a more recent addition to Berkshire's portfolio. Buffett initiated a stake in the giant oil and gas producer in 2020 when its shares were beaten down due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nBerkshire owned 118,610,534 shares of Chevron at the end of the third quarter of 2024. With the company's dividend of $6.52, the conglomerate should make at least $773.3 million in dividend income this year. Again, though, the actual total will likely be higher. Chevron has increased its dividend for 37 consecutive years and could boost its payout soon.\n\n4. American Express\n\nBuffett wrote to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders last year that American Express(NYSE: AXP) would \"almost certainly\" increase its dividends in 2024 by around 16%. He was close. Amex increased its dividend payout by nearly 17%.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe legendary investor also wrote that Berkshire would \"most certainly leave our holdings untouched throughout the year.\" I suspect it will do the same in 2025. If so, Berkshire's 151,610,700 shares of American Express with the financial services company's dividend of $2.80 will add up to at least $424.5 million in dividend income this year.\n\n5. Apple\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) isn't the apple of Buffett's eye that it once was. His position in the consumer tech giant is much lower now than it was a couple of years ago. However, Apple remains Berkshire's largest holding. It's also still an important source of dividend income.\n\nThe math with Apple is easy. Berkshire owned 300 million shares as of Sept. 30, 2024. With a dividend of $1 per share, that translates to $300 million in dividend income for Buffett and his company in 2025. This amount will change if Apple increases its dividend (which is likely) or Buffett sells more of the stock (which could happen).\n\nWhich is the best stock of the five for income investors?\n\nThe expected dividend income for Buffett and Berkshire from these five stocks in 2025 totals $3.07 billion. Which is the best pick for income investors?\n\nI think income investors who aren't billionaires will find several of Buffett's major income producers attractive picks. Coca-Cola offers an especially impressive dividend track record along with a solid forward dividend yield of 3.14%.\n\nHowever, my vote goes to Chevron as the best stock of the five for income investors. The oil and gas company has the highest dividend yield of the group (4.17%). It has also reliably increased its dividend.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Chevron right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Chevron, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Chevron wasn\u2019t one of them.

This suggests continued confidence, albeit at a reduced level, in Apple.

One of the biggest analyst calls for Thursday, January 23, has been for Apple Inc. Goldman Sachs reiterated the stock as \u201cBuy\u201d and lowered its price target to $280 per share from $286. The price target downgrade, driven by lower iPhone sales, comes ahead of the company\u2019s December-quarter earnings report next week. The firm anticipates the tech giant to report fiscal Q1 earnings per share of $2.35, in line with consensus, and revenue of $124.2B versus the consensus of $124.8B. According to the firm, even though the competition within the Chinese market is increasing, it is optimistic about accelerating iPhone growth in fiscal 2026. This iPhone growth will largely be driven by the continued rollout of Apple Intelligence with a more robust feature set.\n\n\u201cWe anticipate market sentiment to improve midyear, which is a seasonally strong period for the stock, as concerns about Apple Intelligence\u2019s limited impact on iPhone demand and competition in China are replaced by optimism over the new slate of Apple Intelligence features revealed at WWDC 2025, the launch of new Mac, iPad and iPhone SE products in spring 2025, and potential new features for the iPhone 17/18 in fall 2025/26\u201d.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of top trending AI stocks on Wall Street.

        "content": "Steven Cohen runs Point72 Asset Management, a hedge fund that has earned $38 billion in profits since its inception in 1992. That makes him the 12th-most successful hedge fund manager in history, according to LCH Investments.\n\nIn the third quarter, Cohen sold his entire stake in Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), formerly his second-largest holding excluding options. He also started a small position in Axon Enterprise(NASDAQ: AXON), an artificial intelligence (AI) stock up 500% in the last 30 months. The new position is relatively small, but it still means Cohen was more comfortable owning Axon than Apple.\n\nImportantly, Cohen is an excellent source of inspiration, given his track record, but those trades took place in the third quarter, and the fourth-quarter update isn't due for a few weeks. So, here is a more current look at Apple and Axon.\n\nApple: The stock Cohen sold in the third quarter\n\nApple has cultivated immense brand authority through engineering expertise. The company enjoys a strong presence in several consumer electronics markets, including a leadership position in smartphones in terms of revenue. Consumer loyalty has also helped Apple grow its services business. But the company is beset by headwinds that threaten to drag on profitability in the coming years.\n\nApple's iPhone has lost significant market share in China. The company has yet to announce financial results for the December quarter, but Counterpoint Research says iPhone sales declined more than 18% in that period. Consequently, after leading the China market in smartphone sales in 2023, Apple failed to rank among the top three sellers in 2024.\n\nFurthermore, Apple could lose $20 billion in annual services revenue if federal judge Amit Mehta prohibits Alphabet's Google from paying for default search placement in the Safari browser. His decision is expected in August 2025, and a long appeals process may follow, but analysts estimate Apple could lose 4% to 6% of its profits if the deal is prohibited.\n\nAdditionally, many analysts anticipated a historic iPhone upgrade cycle following the introduction of AI features (called Apple Intelligence) in October, but that has yet to materialized. Indeed, Craig Moffett at MoffettNathanson recently wrote, \"Not only have we not seen any sign of an upgrade cycle, but we have seen growing evidence that consumers are unmoved by AI functionality.\"\n\nFinally, Wall Street expects Apple's earnings to increase 9% over the next year. That consensus makes the current valuation of 33 times earnings look expensive. Moreover, while Apple stock has returned 72% in the last two years, its price-to-earnings ratio has also increased 72% over that period. That means shares moved higher on multiple expansion alone, not earnings growth.\n\nStory Continues\n\nInvestors should avoid this stock.\n\nAxon Enterprise: The stock Cohen bought in the third quarter\n\nAxon is a public safety company that works with U.S. law enforcement, the federal government, commercial enterprises, and certain international governments. While Axon is best known for conducted energy devices sold under the Taser brand, the company also provides body cameras and other sensors that integrate with software for digital evidence management, reporting, and real-time situational awareness.\n\nImportantly, Axon has added a number of artificial intelligence features to its software products, such as automatic transcription and redaction of video evidence, as well as automated license plate reading. Its latest AI product, Draft One, uses body camera recordings to draft off police reports. Draft One achieved a $100 million revenue pipeline faster than any product in company history.\n\nAxon reported solid financial results in the third quarter. Revenue increased 32% to $544 million on strong sales growth in Tasers, body cameras, and digital evidence management software. Meanwhile, non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) earnings increased 19% to $1.45 per diluted share. The company also raised its full-year outlook, such that revenue is projected to increase 32% in 2024. Axon is well positioned to maintain its growth trajectory.\n\nThe company is the market leader in Tasers, body cameras, and digital evidence management software, and it has momentum in drones and robotics. CEO Rick Smith recently said, \"We are positioning ourselves as the indisputable leader in delivering the power of AI in practical, usable applications.\" Yet Axon has captured less than 3% of its $77 billion addressable market, leaving a long runway for growth.\n\nUnfortunately, valuation is somewhat concerning. Wall Street expects the company's earnings to increase at 22% annually through 2025. That estimate makes the current multiple of 120 times adjusted earnings look very expensive. Having said that, Axon reported earnings above the consensus in the last 12 quarters, and it beat the consensus by an average of 34% in the last six quarters.\n\nIf that pattern continues, the stock may appear reasonably valued in hindsight. So, risk-tolerant investors with a time horizon of at least three to five years should consider buying a very small position today.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

                "reasoning": "The news highlights significant concerns regarding Apple's market position, particularly in China, and potential revenue losses from legal challenges. Additionally, the lack of a strong iPhone upgrade cycle and high valuation metrics suggest bearish sentiment. Steven Cohen's decision to sell his entire stake in Apple, a move that indicates a lack of confidence in the stock, further supports the likelihood of a price decline. Given these factors, the probability of Apple's stock price falling is higher than that of it rising."

                "reasoning": "The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While a prominent investor like Steven Cohen selling his stake can be a negative signal, it's important to consider the context. The article highlights several headwinds for Apple, including declining iPhone sales in China, potential loss of revenue from the Google search deal, lack of a significant upgrade cycle driven by AI features, and a high valuation relative to earnings growth. These factors suggest a higher probability of a stock price decline. However, Apple is a large, established company with a strong brand and loyal customer base, which provides some downside protection. The 'Double Down' recommendation for Apple from Motley Fool analysts also suggests a potential for future growth, although the article primarily focuses on past successes. Considering these factors, I estimate a higher probability of a stock price fall in the short term."

While Steven Cohen selling his stake is bearish, the article highlights several significant headwinds for Apple: declining iPhone sales in China, potential loss of services revenue due to a legal battle, and the failure of the AI features to boost sales as anticipated.  These factors suggest a higher probability of a price fall. However, Apple still maintains a strong brand and a large market share in several sectors. The 9% earnings growth expectation, although considered expensive at 33 times earnings, still indicates some positive momentum.  The article's conclusion to 'avoid this stock' is a strong bearish signal.  Conversely, the news also mentions Axon Enterprise, a company Cohen invested in, which is presented in a more positive light with strong growth prospects and AI integration.  The contrasting perspectives on Apple and Axon, coupled with the bearish conclusion regarding Apple, heavily influence the probability assessment. The mention of Cohen's sale is relevant but less impactful than the fundamental issues facing Apple discussed in the article itself."

Additionally, the stock's current valuation is considered expensive with earnings growth not keeping pace with the price-to-earnings ratio expansion. These factors collectively suggest a bearish outlook for AAPL in the short to medium term.

        "headline": "Mag 7 Earnings On Deck: A Closer Look",
        "content": "This week takes us into the heart of the Q4 earnings season, with more than 300 companies reporting results, including four Magnificent 7 members and 96 other S&P 500 members. We have Tesla TSLA, Microsoft MSFT, and Meta Platform META on Wednesday, January 29th, and Apple AAPL on Thursday, January 30th.\n\nApple shares have struggled lately, with the stock lagging behind the Mag 7 group and the broader market. The stock hit the 52-week high around Christmas and has since lost about 15% of its value on persistent worries about China and its AI strategy. The chart below shows the one-year performance of Apple, Microsoft, Meta, and Tesla relative to the S&P 500 index.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nTesla shares have truly been on a tear since the last quarterly release on October 23rd, with the stock up more than +85% since the day before that release. Market participants appear convinced that Tesla\u2019s competitive challenges are behind it. We will see if this Wednesday\u2019s quarterly release validates this view.\n\nThe very positive sentiment on Tesla contrasts the dour views on Apple where some of the more bearish analysts are projecting a guidance cut. While estimates for the December quarter have been stable lately, estimates for the current and following fiscal years have been under pressure. The current Zacks Consensus EPS for fiscal year 2025 (ends in September) for Apple of $7.40 is down from $7.43 a week ago and $7.49 three months back.\n\nApple bulls see this all-around downbeat sentiment as overdone. While they acknowledge the China headwinds, they believe that the issue is manageable for the company and expect Apple to announce a local AI partner in the next few months. Baidu appears to be the front-line candidate, but analysts also mention Tencent and TikTok parent ByteDance as in the running.\n\nThe table below shows net margins for the group, with Tesla\u2019s 2024 Q4 net margins of 7.4% only modestly down from 7.9% in the year-earlier period, while Apple\u2019s margins are expected to be modestly up from the year-earlier period.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nUnlike Tesla and Apple, the issue with Microsoft is the capex overhang, with the market concerned about the company\u2019s heavy investments in AI infrastructure without a tangible monetization plan.\n\nThe capex question isn\u2019t restricted to Microsoft alone, as Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta also face the same issue. Of these four, the problem is particularly central for Alphabet as many in the market see AI as potentially risking the company\u2019s search monopoly. Alphabet did a good job in its last earnings release on that front, but this will likely remain an ongoing issue in the Google story.\n\nStory Continues\n\nTake a look at the chart below that shows current consensus expectations for the \u2018Mag 7\u2019 stocks as a whole for the current and coming periods in the context of what they were able to achieve in the preceding period.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAs you can see, the group is expected to bring in +20.9% more earnings in Q4 relative to the same period last year on +12.2% higher revenues.\n\nThe chart below shows the group\u2019s earnings and revenue growth on an annual basis.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAs we all know by now, the group\u2019s phenomenal boost in 2021 partly reflected pulled forward demand from future periods that got adjusted mostly in 2022. The group got back into \u2018regular/normal\u2019 growth mode in 2023, and the trend is expected to continue this year and beyond.\n\nQ4 Earnings Season Scorecard\n\nThrough Friday, January 24th, we have seen Q4 results from 78 S&P 500 members, or 15.6% of the index\u2019s total membership. Total earnings for these companies are up +17.4% from the same period last year on +6.2% higher revenues, with 83.3% beating EPS estimates and 66.7% beating revenue estimates.\n\nThe comparison charts below put the Q4 earnings and revenue growth rates relative to other recent periods for the same group of index members.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe comparison charts below put the Q4 EPS and revenue beats percentages relative to other recent periods for the same group of companies.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFor the Finance sector, we now have 45.5% of the sector\u2019s market capitalization in the S&P 500 index. Total earnings for these Finance sector companies are up +27.5% from the same period last year on +10.9% higher revenues, with all the companies beating EPS estimates (100%) and 80% surpassing revenue estimates.\n\nThe comparison charts below put the Q4 results from these Finance sector companies in a historical context. The first set of charts shows how the Q4 earnings and revenue growth rates for these Finance companies compare to other recent periods.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nHere is how the Q4 EPS and revenue beat percentages for these companies compare to other recent periodsZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nKey Earnings Reports This Week\n\nThe 100 S&P 500 members on deck to report results this week include several blue-chip operators like Boeing, GM, Starbucks, IBM, Southwest Airlines, Comcast, International Paper, and others, in addition to the aforementioned Mag 7 players.\n\nBy the end of this week, we will have seen Q4 results from more than 35% of the index\u2019s total membership.\n\nThe Earnings Big Picture\n\nThe chart below shows the Q4 earnings and revenue growth expectations in the context of where growth has been in the preceding four quarters and what is expected in the coming four quarters.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nExcluding contributions from the Mag 7 companies, S&P 500 earnings would have been up +5.7% on +3.8% higher revenues.\n\nThe chart below shows the overall earnings picture on a calendar-year basis, with double-digit earnings growth expected in 2025 and 2026.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nPlease note that the very strong growth expected in 2025 is not driven by one or two sectors but is rather broad-based.

However, bullish analysts believe the negative sentiment is overdone and point to potential partnerships in China's AI sector as a positive catalyst.

On the positive side, Apple bulls believe the negative sentiment is overdone, citing manageable China headwinds and potential announcements of a local AI partner, which could boost investor confidence. Given the upcoming earnings report, the stock's movement will likely hinge on whether the results and guidance meet, exceed, or fall short of expectations.

A rate hike could negatively impact growth stocks like Apple, while a pause or cut could be a positive signal. Given these mixed signals, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a stock price rise if Apple's earnings are positive and AI strategy is well-received. However, the Fed's decision and overall market conditions will also be crucial."

The overall impact is uncertain, with both positive and negative factors at play.  Given the uncertainty and the potential for both positive and negative news to influence the stock price, I'm assigning roughly equal probabilities to a rise and a fall, slightly favoring a rise due to the potential for positive AI-related news."

Apple's earnings report will be closely watched, especially for insights into its performance in AI and other key areas. Positive earnings could lead to a stock price rise, while disappointing results could cause a decline. The Fed's rate decision is also critical; a dovish stance (no rate hike or hints of future cuts) could boost tech stocks, including Apple, while a hawkish stance might pressure them. Given Apple's strong historical performance and market position, the probability of a positive reaction is slightly higher, but uncertainty around the Fed's decision tempers this optimism."

The earnings report could potentially have a significant impact on the stock price. Historically, Apple's stock price has been influenced by its earnings reports, with the company's stock often experiencing volatility following the release of its financial results. Additionally, the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision could also affect the stock market, including Apple's stock price. However, it's difficult to predict the exact outcome, as the company's performance and the overall market sentiment will play a crucial role. Given that the article does not provide overwhelmingly positive or negative information specific to Apple, and considering that the earnings report could potentially beat or meet expectations, there's a cautiously optimistic view that the stock price might rise. However, the probability of a stock price rise or fall also depends on how the company's performance compares to investor expectations and the overall market conditions."

However, the article does not provide any specific information about Apple's earnings expectations or the potential impact of the interest rate decision on the company. Given the lack of specific information, I will assume that the earnings report and interest rate decision have an equal chance of positively or negatively impacting the stock price. Additionally, the mention of artificial intelligence as a central theme in the earnings reports could be seen as a positive factor for Apple, as the company has been investing heavily in AI research and development. Therefore, I will assign a slightly higher probability to the stock price rising."

However, the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision could create volatility across the markets, affecting Apple's stock price. Given the dual influence of both positive earnings expectations and the uncertain impact of the Fed's decision, the probabilities are finely balanced."

On one hand, a prominent investor, Steven Cohen, selling Apple stock could be interpreted negatively, potentially signaling a lack of confidence in Apple's future growth or a reallocation of assets to more promising opportunities. On the other hand, the investment in a rapidly growing AI stock could be seen as a strategic move towards higher-growth sectors, which might indirectly benefit Apple if AI integration becomes a significant factor in Apple's products. However, the direct impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be slightly negative, as the news focuses on the sale of Apple shares. The magnitude of the impact is likely to be small, given Apple's size and the fact that this is just one investor's decision.

However, the news lacks specifics and doesn't provide any negative information about Apple's fundamentals.  Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal.

However, it's essential to note that stock movements are influenced by a myriad of factors, and one investor's action does not dictate the overall market's sentiment. Given this context, there might be a slightly higher probability of Apple's stock price falling due to this news, as investors might interpret Cohen's move as a sign of waning confidence in Apple's future growth.

However, the news could trigger some selling pressure from investors who are already hesitant or looking for reasons to take profits.  The probability of a price fall is higher than a price rise, but the magnitude of the movement is likely to be relatively small given Apple's overall market position and the fact that it's just one analyst's opinion.

The mention of large moves both up and down indicates uncertainty in the market.

Given Apple's strong market position and historical performance, there is a higher probability of a price rise despite the potential for volatility."

        "content": "We recently published a list of 15 Stocks ChatGPT Predicts Could Make You Wealthy in 10 Years. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other stocks ChatGPT predicts could make you wealthy in 10 years.\n\n2024 was a stellar year for the US markets, driven by a strong performance in the technology sector. The broader market expanded by more than 23% during the year, marking two consecutive years of over 20% growth\u2014something that had not happened in nearly three decades.\n\nREAD ALSO: 10 Best Single Digit Stocks To Buy Now and 10 Under-the-Radar Stocks with Massive Upside for 2025.\n\nThe stock market benefited from a resilient economy that avoided recession, declining interest rates, and waning inflation. Analysts are projecting continued growth in 2025 amid strong economic data and optimism about a business-friendly Trump administration returning to power.\n\nIn a note on December 30, Wedbush Securities analyst, Dan Ives, wrote that he expects a 25% surge in tech stocks as the new government focuses on slashing unnecessary regulations. On the other hand, Todd Rosenbluth, the head of research at VettaFi, anticipates that ETFs specializing in small-caps will make gains as investors broaden their market exposure with interest rates dropping.\n\nWhile the general outlook for 2025 is encouraging, analysts are also cautious about the potential downsides of the new administration\u2019s promised tariffs. Following his election victory, Trump has vowed to impose steep tariffs on imports from Canada, China, and Mexico, which could increase manufacturers\u2019 costs. Ongoing geopolitical tensions in different parts of the world could also hurt the stock market.\n\nCan ChatGPT predict the stock market?\n\nA growing number of investors are turning to ChatGPT for stock suggestions. According to a 2023 survey, around 53% of the Millenials and 50% of Generation Z respondents had used the AI chatbot for investing advice. In contrast, older Americans were skeptical of the recommendations, with only 25% of the Baby Boomers saying they had used ChatGPT to buy stocks.\n\nWhile most financial analysts question the reliability of ChatGPT for providing accurate and up-to-date information, Alejandro Lopez-Lira, a finance professor at the University of Florida, says that the chatbot may be able to predict stock movements. He used the platform to parse negative and positive headlines for stocks and predict returns for the following day. Lopez-Lira was surprised to find how good the results were.\n\nWhether or not tools like ChatGPT are effective in recommending stocks and predicting their trajectory remains a debate. However, they can be useful for investors researching the companies they want to invest in or when looking up definitions of financial terms they are unfamiliar with.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMethodology\n\nWe prompted ChatGPT to predict 15 stocks that could make investors wealthy in 10 years and cite the reasons behind its analysis. The stocks are ranked in this article in the same order as provided by ChatGPT. The platform said it based its rankings on several factors, including market dominance, revenue and earnings growth, innovation, and industry growth potential.\n\nFor perspective, we have also shared the hedge fund sentiment toward each stock, based on Insider Monkey\u2019s database of over 900 prominent hedge funds as of Q3 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) Among The Stocks ChatGPT Predicts Could Make You Wealthy in 10 Years?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a leading American technology company known for its consumer electronics, software, and other related products. Its premium line of products, which includes the iPhone, iPad, Mac computers, and a range of other accessories, has earned Apple widespread acclaim and customer loyalty.\n\nOn October 31, the company announced financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, beating Wall Street expectations for both revenue and earnings. It posted a quarterly revenue of $94.9 billion, up 6% year-over-year. The iPhone, which accounts for nearly half of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u2019s overall revenue, registered a 6% growth in revenue.\n\nThe company\u2019s newest iPhone device, launched on September 20, gave Apple only a week of sales ahead of the earnings call. Despite that, the tech giant had a record business performance during the month, driving nearly $27 billion in operating cash flow. This allowed the company to return over $29 billion to shareholders for Q4 in dividends and repurchases.\n\nThe integration of artificial intelligence in the newly launched iPhone 16 has renewed investor confidence. Mar Vista Focus strategy stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\nInvestors were reminded of the strength of the Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) ecosystem as management demonstrated how generative AI solutions would be integrated into Apple\u2019s 1.2 billion iPhone installed base. Apple plans to integrate generative AI features into its iOS 18, which will be broadly released in the fall with the iPhone 16. We believe Apple should benefit from generative AI as it will spur a meaningful iPhone upgrade cycle and create new avenues of monetization through its app store and advertising offerings. We believe this will support intrinsic value growth ranging between high-single-digits and low-double-digits over our investment horizon.\n\nWall Street analysts are bullish on the stock with a consensus Buy rating and average share price upside potential of 8%.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 1st on our list of stocks ChatGPT predicts could make you wealthy in 10 years. While we acknowledge the potential of technology companies, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

The article also mentions the broader market's positive performance and analysts' projections for continued growth in 2025. However, the article also acknowledges potential downsides, such as the impact of potential tariffs under a Trump administration and ongoing geopolitical tensions. The article also mentions that the author believes AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns in a shorter time frame.

The market may react positively in the short term, but the overall impact is likely to be small compared to other factors influencing Apple's stock price, such as broader market trends and overall financial performance. The fact that the AI improvements are focused on Siri, which hasn't been a major revenue driver for Apple, also limits the potential positive impact.

Additionally, the fact that other major companies like Nasdaq and JPMorgan Chase & Co. are also standing firm on their DEI values suggests that Apple is part of a broader trend. Therefore, the news is likely to have a neutral to slightly positive impact on Apple's stock price."

                "reasoning": "The news discusses a potential rollback of DEI programs by President Trump, which could impact Apple Inc. (AAPL). While this news may cause concerns among some stakeholders, it is important to note that Apple has strong support for DEI programs, and similar votes have been defended by other major companies such as Costco. Additionally, the overall market perception and the company's strong financial performance are likely to outweigh the immediate impact of this news."

        "content": "Big Tech earnings are coming next week. Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META), and Tesla (TSLA) all report on Wednesday, while Apple (AAPL) reports on Thursday. Wedbush Securities managing director and global head of technology research Dan Ives joins Morning Brief with Seana Smith and Brad Smith to discuss what to watch during Big Tech earnings.\n\nIves tells investors to \"get the popcorn out\" for Big Tech earnings, noting that Mark Zuckerberg's announcement that Meta plans to spend up to $65 billion on artificial intelligence (AI) capital expenditures (CapEx) is \"the start of this massive build-out of AI CapEx that I think the Street's massively underestimating.\"\n\nIves says Big Tech's massive AI spending depends on the use case for each company.\n\n\"Ultimately, when you look at Meta, the AI capabilities on advertising, on subscriber growth, and ultimately, building out businesses that don't even exist today because it's all about monetizing that install base ... it's no different than the way that the hyperscalers have done it with Microsoft, Amazon, Google.\" the analyst explains.

                "reasoning": "The news focuses on Dan Ives' positive outlook on Big Tech earnings, particularly highlighting the underestimation of AI CapEx spending. While the article mentions Apple reporting earnings, the primary focus is on Meta's AI investments and the broader implications for the tech sector. Ives' comments suggest a potential for positive surprises in earnings and future growth driven by AI. However, the article doesn't provide specific details about Apple's AI strategy or expected performance. Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock price is indirect and relies on the overall positive sentiment towards the tech sector. Given the positive sentiment and Ives' reputation, a slight positive movement is more likely, but the lack of specific Apple-related information limits the potential upside. The risk of a fall is still present, especially if Apple's earnings report is perceived as weak relative to expectations or if the broader market experiences a downturn."

                "reasoning": "The news focuses on the broader Big Tech sector's increased investment in AI, with Apple mentioned only in passing as a company reporting earnings next week.  Dan Ives's comments are largely centered on Meta's AI spending and its potential impact. While positive sentiment towards AI investment exists, the news doesn't provide any specific information about Apple's performance or prospects. Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be indirect and relatively muted compared to the direct impact on companies like Meta.  The overall market reaction to Big Tech earnings will be a significant factor, but this news alone doesn't provide a strong indication of whether Apple's stock will rise or fall.  We assume a neutral stance with slightly higher probability of no significant change."

Although Apple is not the main focus of the discussion, its inclusion in the Big Tech earnings lineup suggests that general optimism about the tech sector could buoy its stock. However, without specific positive mention of Apple's prospects, the impact may be more muted compared to companies directly highlighted like Meta. Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall, but both probabilities remain moderate."

Ives' positive outlook on Big Tech, including Apple, could lead to increased investor confidence and a potential rise in stock price. However, the news is more focused on the overall Big Tech sector rather than Apple specifically, and Ives' comments about Meta's AI spending may not directly impact Apple's stock price. Therefore, I estimate a moderate probability of Apple's stock price rising and a lower probability of it falling."

BofA analysts continue to see strong Q1 results but warn that the March quarter will be weak, with iPhone sales likely to decline to 49 million units versus the consensus of 52 million. Macroeconomic headwinds and slower adoption of Apple Intelligence features are to blame for the decline.\n\nBofA cut its iPhone sales forecasts for fiscal years 2025 and 2026 to 229 million for 2025 and 246 million for 2026 from 262 million each. However, the bank is still bullish on the stock, noting Apple's strong cash flow, margin resiliency and its possible pending product launches, including the iPhone SE with an in-house 5G modem. BofA says concerns about weak iPhone sales in China are overdone, given that it has cut prices and will receive potential government subsidies. Analysts adjust the price target for Apple to $253 from $256 as the company's new FY26 EPS forecast of $8.37 yields a 30x multiple.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

However, the warning about a decline in iPhone sales and the adjustment of sales forecasts for the next two years introduces some uncertainty. Despite these challenges, BofA remains bullish on the stock due to strong cash flow and potential product launches. The slight reduction in the price target suggests a cautious optimism.

                "reasoning": "The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. The immediate term (Q1 earnings) is expected to be positive, which typically drives the stock price up. However, the medium-term outlook (March quarter and FY25/26 iPhone sales) is negative, potentially pulling the stock price down. BofA's continued bullish stance and price target adjustment offer some support. The key factors influencing the probabilities are: 1) Strong Q1 earnings beat expectation, 2) Weak iPhone sales forecast for the March quarter and beyond, 3) BofA's bullish outlook and price target, and 4) Potential positive catalysts like the new iPhone SE and government subsidies in China. Considering these factors, the positive Q1 earnings are likely to have a stronger immediate impact, but the negative forecasts will temper the rise. The bullish analyst sentiment provides a floor. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a rise than a fall."

While Q1 earnings are expected to beat estimates,  BofA's lowered iPhone sales forecasts for FY2025 and FY2026, citing macroeconomic headwinds and slower adoption of Apple Intelligence features, suggest potential future weakness.  The reduction in the price target from $256 to $253 reflects this concern. However, BofA remains bullish, highlighting strong cash flow, margin resiliency, and potential future product launches (iPhone SE with in-house 5G modem) as mitigating factors.  The claim that concerns about weak Chinese sales are overdone due to price cuts and potential subsidies also provides a positive counterpoint.  Considering the positive Q1 earnings expectation and the bullish outlook despite lowered future forecasts, the probability of a price rise is slightly higher than a price fall in the short term, but the overall uncertainty warrants a relatively low probability for both outcomes."

On the negative side, iPhone sales are projected to decline in the March quarter, and macroeconomic headwinds along with slower adoption of Apple Intelligence features are cited as challenges. The slight reduction in BofA's price target from $256 to $253 reflects minor adjustments but not a significant bearish outlook.

Despite being a part of the Magnificent 7 and having a strong historical performance, the current sentiment around Apple is negative due to its high forward P/E ratio of 30.1 and recent price weakness.

It also points out that Apple is not cheap, with a forward P/E ratio of 30.1, and has a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell). The article poses the question of whether further declines in Apple's stock price would present a buying opportunity. The overall tone is neutral to slightly negative, given the underperformance and 'Sell' rating. The podcast aims to provide further insights, but the information presented suggests potential downward pressure on the stock in the short term.

The mention of Apple in the context of a broader market discussion doesn't provide any specific positive catalyst for a price increase.

(AAPL, Financial) Fiscal First Quarter 2025 results is anticipated to draw market players' attention, with the global market conditions taking a toll on the sector. Apple is expected to post revenue of $124 billion this quarter, a nice 3% year-over-year increase. EPS is expected to rise from $1.47 in the previous quarter to $2.35.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with OONEF.\n\nTo a large extent, Apple's stock relies on the emergent performance of its core iPhone lineup, which brings in a large chunk of the company's revenue. Red flags are going up for analysts regarding iPhone sales volumes as signs of plateauing consumer demand emerge.

        "headline": "Apple Enlists Veteran Software Executive to Help Fix AI and Siri",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. executive Kim Vorrath, a company veteran known for fixing troubled products and bringing major projects to market, has a new job: whipping artificial intelligence and Siri into shape.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nWhat Happened to Hanging Out on the Street? How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump Billionaire Developer Caruso Slams LA Leadership Over Wildfires Hoboken PATH Station Will Close for Almost a Month on Jan. 30 Texas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters\n\nVorrath, a vice president in charge of program management, was moved to Apple\u2019s artificial intelligence and machine learning division this week, according to people with knowledge of the matter. She\u2019ll be a top deputy to AI chief John Giannandrea, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the change hasn\u2019t been announced publicly.\n\nThe move helps bolster a team that\u2019s racing to make Apple a leader in AI \u2014 an area where it\u2019s fallen behind technology peers. The company has struggled to match the capabilities of OpenAI, Meta Platforms Inc. and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google. And its Apple Intelligence platform has suffered from a slow and bumpy rollout.\n\nThe Siri digital assistant, groundbreaking when it was unveiled in 2011, has come to symbolize Apple\u2019s shortcomings in AI. Upstarts like OpenAI have created their own, more versatile chatbots, and smartphone rival Samsung Electronics Co. has been faster to weave artificial intelligence features into its software. Amazon.com Inc. also is adapting its Alexa platform for the AI world.\n\nVorrath, who has spent 36 years at Apple, is known for managing the development of tough software projects. She\u2019s also put procedures in place that can catch and fix bugs. Vorrath joins the new team from Apple\u2019s hardware engineering division, where she helped launch the Vision Pro headset.\n\nA spokesperson for Cupertino, California-based Apple declined to comment on the move.\n\nOver the years, Vorrath has had a hand in several of Apple\u2019s biggest endeavors. In the mid-2000s, she was chosen to lead project management for the original iPhone software group and get the iconic device ready for consumers. Until 2019, she oversaw project management for the iPhone, iPad and Mac operating systems, before taking on the Vision Pro software. Haley Allen will replace Vorrath overseeing program management for visionOS, the headset\u2019s operating system, according to the people.\n\nPrior to joining Giannandrea\u2019s organization, Vorrath had spent several weeks advising Kelsey Peterson, the group\u2019s previous head of program management. Peterson will now report to Vorrath \u2014 as will two other AI executives, Cindy Lin and Marc Schonbrun. Giannandrea, who joined Apple from Google in 2018, disclosed the changes in a memo sent to staffers.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe move signals that AI is now more important than the Vision Pro, which launched in February 2024, and is seen as the biggest challenge within the company, according to a longtime Apple executive who asked not to be identified. Vorrath has a knack for organizing engineering groups and creating an effective workflow with new processes, the executive said.\n\nIt has been clear for some time now that Giannandrea needs additional help managing an AI group with growing prominence, according to the executive. Vorrath is poised to bring Apple\u2019s product development culture to the AI work, the person said.\n\nThis year, the artificial intelligence group is focused on revamping the underlying infrastructure of Siri and improving the company\u2019s in-house AI models, Giannandrea said in the memo.\n\nThe company debuted its Apple Intelligence platform in October, but the initial version only included basic features like text-message and notification summarization. More advanced capabilities like Genmoji \u2014 a tool for creating custom emoji via AI \u2014 have launched more recently.\n\nApple has promised to overhaul Siri as part of the AI rollout, but that element isn\u2019t ready yet. The company aims to release a new version of the digital assistant as part of iOS 18.4 in April, Bloomberg has reported. The new version is designed to better respond to queries by tapping into the customer\u2019s data. It also can identify what\u2019s currently on a user\u2019s screen and more precisely control the device\u2019s applications through a system called App Intents.\n\nThe current version of Siri has drawn criticism for not understanding requests and failing to execute simple commands. And even when the promised features do launch, they won\u2019t match the capabilities unveiled by Samsung, which uses a mix of its own technology and the Google Gemini platform.\n\nApple is working on an even more advanced version of Siri that includes a more conversational interface \u2014 something more in line with ChatGPT and other AI offerings. It won\u2019t be ready until at least 2026, though Apple may give a preview of the software this year, Bloomberg has reported.\n\nIn another setback, Apple recently came under fire for inaccurate AI-generated news recaps. In one instance, the company summarized the BBC to falsely state that Luigi Mangione \u2014 charged with killing a health care executive \u2014 had shot himself.\n\nApple responded to the flap by removing the feature for news and entertainment apps in its next software update. The company didn\u2019t say when the capability would return.\n\nLast year, Apple enlisted another top manager to help bring order to Giannandrea\u2019s group. When the company\u2019s self-driving car project was shuttered in February, longtime software executive Kevin Lynch was shifted to the AI division. He now runs Apple\u2019s secretive robotics team within the organization.\n\nWhen Giannandrea joined Apple seven years ago, he originally served as a vice president reporting to Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook. He was soon promoted to Apple\u2019s executive team \u2014 a small cadre of top brass. But in recent months, current and former executives have expressed concerns about his ability to turn Apple into a force in AI.\n\nVorrath has a chance to impose more discipline on the effort, according to the executive who asked not to be named. Though the Vision Pro hasn\u2019t been a hit with consumers, she brought sanity and reason to that product\u2019s development team, the person said, and the software was vastly improved.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nForget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations The CDC Won\u2019t Give the Public a Full Picture of Fertility Treatment Risks How Kendrick Lamar Turned Beef With Drake Into Music Superstardom Elon Musk\u2019s Inaugural Highs (and Lows) Greek Police Say Eggs Were Stolen from IVF Clinic Patients\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments",

Her track record of successfully managing complex software projects, including the original iPhone and Vision Pro, suggests she can bring much-needed structure and efficiency to Apple's AI division. The fact that Apple is prioritizing AI over Vision Pro also signals a strategic shift that investors might view favorably. While the article mentions concerns about the current AI chief, the addition of Vorrath is likely to be seen as a step in the right direction.

His current role with the firm includes mentoring the committee that has oversight over the company's investment strategies.\n\nThe investment veteran, with an estimated net worth of $14 billion, is no stranger to making against-the-grain markets and economic calls.

The Bridgewater Associates founder (right) speaks with Yahoo Finance executive editor Brian Sozzi (left) at the 2025 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. The two talked on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast.\u00b7Yahoo Finance\n\nIn an April 2022 interview, Dalio warned me about a period of stagflation \u2014or slow growth and high inflation. That didn't exactly pan out from a growth standpoint as the world recovered from the COVID-19 pandemic. But global economies continue to grapple with elevated levels of inflation that are crimping consumer purchasing power.\n\nMore recently, Dalio has been calling attention to the US's bloated deficit, which hit a staggering $1.8 trillion in fiscal year 2024. He shares more of his debt concerns in a new online book called \"How Countries Go Broke.\"\n\nWorst-case scenarios on the US debt (such as a major inflation outbreak) haven't occurred. But the markets are not ignoring the issue, with the Trump administration likely adding to debt levels by extending his signature tax cuts.\n\nRead more: Why TD Ameritrade's former CEO is bullish on the Trump trade\n\nInvestors are fretting over a 10-year bond yield hovering close to 5%, a rising US dollar, risk of a trade war from the Trump administration, policy uncertainty from the Fed, and pullbacks in top Mag Seven names like Nvidia.\n\nSee more from the Opening Bid podcast\n\nAnother bitcoin bubble will happen: Nouriel 'Dr. Doom' Roubini Elon Musk is our best chance in a lifetime at fixing government spending: Former Tesla exec Why you should buy the 493 other S&P 500 stocks \u2014 and not the Mag 7\n\nStocks are \"priced for perfection,\" warned Goldman Sachs strategist Peter Oppenheimer this month.\n\nDalio thinks the US needs to get its debt situation in order. Since that's unlikely to happen in the near-term, Dalio said the average investor should be taking a hard look at their portfolio.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\"I will say that the important thing if you're building a portfolio is to know how to have excellent diversification, to not be systematically leveraged long.

                "reasoning": "The news headline and content present a bearish outlook for Apple (AAPL) and other 'Magnificent Seven' stocks. Ray Dalio, a respected investor, believes these stocks are expensive and vulnerable to rising interest rates. While Dalio's past predictions haven't always been accurate, his concerns about US debt and the potential impact on overvalued stocks carry weight. The article also mentions other factors contributing to market uncertainty, such as rising bond yields, a strong dollar, and potential trade wars. While the article doesn't specifically target Apple, the general sentiment towards large-cap tech stocks is negative. Given the negative sentiment and the potential for a market correction, the probability of a stock price fall is higher than a rise."

                "reasoning": "Ray Dalio, a prominent billionaire investor, expresses concern about the high valuations of leading stocks, including Apple, citing rising interest rates as a potential headwind.  He mentions the risk of a 'rotation' away from these high-momentum names. While Dalio doesn't explicitly mention Apple's specific situation, his broader concerns about overvalued tech stocks and rising interest rates suggest a negative outlook for Apple's stock price in the short to medium term.  The news also highlights broader market anxieties, including US debt concerns and potential trade wars, which could further negatively impact Apple's performance.  However, Apple's strong brand and loyal customer base provide some resilience.  Therefore, the probability of a price fall is considered higher than a price rise, but not overwhelmingly so, reflecting the uncertainty inherent in market predictions."

                "reasoning": "The news article discusses billionaire investor Ray Dalio's warning about the inflated prices of major stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), which is part of the 'Magnificent Seven' group. Dalio suggests that these stocks are expensive and could be negatively impacted by rising interest rates. Given Dalio's influence and the cautious sentiment expressed, investors might reconsider their positions in such stocks, potentially leading to a sell-off. The mention of rising 10-year yields and concerns over US debt levels adds to the bearish outlook. However, the stock market's reaction to such warnings can sometimes be muted if other factors like strong earnings or market sentiment counterbalance the negative news."

(AAPL), suggesting they are 'expensive' and potentially vulnerable to interest rate rises. This negative sentiment from a prominent investor could lead to decreased investor confidence and a potential drop in stock price. However, it's worth noting that market reactions can be unpredictable, and some investors might not align with Dalio's views. Given the context, there's a higher likelihood of a stock price fall than a rise."

He warns that if the 10-year yield continues to rise, these top-momentum names could be hit hard. This warning, combined with Dalio's concerns about the US debt situation and the potential for a period of stagflation, suggests a negative outlook for the stock market.

        "headline": "Apple Tests Key Technical Level in Worst Start Since 2008",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc.\u2019s stock has had a rough start to the year and is now flirting with a key level that could signal more downside ahead if breached.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nWhat Happened to Hanging Out on the Street? How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump Billionaire Developer Caruso Slams LA Leadership Over Wildfires Texas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters Hoboken PATH Station Will Close for Almost a Month on Jan. 30\n\nThe stock has slumped 11% in 2025 through Thursday\u2019s close, making it by far the worst performer in the Magnificent Seven group. It has also significantly underperformed the S&P 500, which has gained about 4% to touch a fresh record high to start the year. Apple\u2019s performance is the worst start of the year for the iPhone maker since 2008, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nThe decline has brought shares within a few dollars of the 200-day moving average, a technical level that can be seen as a long-term support and is one that many traders watch.\n\nThe level is \u201calways a good reference point of trend,\u201d said Todd Sohn, an ETF and technical strategist at Strategas Securities LLC. \u201cWhen you get names starting to flirt with it or start to break below it, you kind of lose confidence that the uptrend of that name is still intact.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a precarious position for Apple shares. The company was, until recently, the largest company by market value in the world, and commanded the largest weighting in the S&P 500 Index. Nvidia has since eclipsed it during Apple\u2019s tumble.\n\nWhile one single stock doesn\u2019t always move the rest of the index, Apple\u2019s size and position make it one to watch. So far, the S&P 500 has continued to rally, even with Apple\u2019s selloff, but if any of the other big technology stocks similarly start to tick lower, it could be a concerning sign for the bull market that\u2019s now entering its third year.\n\n\u201cThe market has been pretty resilient in light of the fact that Apple has been under pressure,\u201d Katie Stockton, managing partner and founder of Fairlead Strategies LLC, said. Still, \u201cit definitely has the potential to create some more risk for those major indices. If we see that downside follow-through that we\u2019re anticipating, that makes it more challenging, of course, for those indices to shrug it off.\u201d\n\nStockton sees further declines for Apple stock, she said. If shares do fall below the 200-day moving average, the next level she\u2019s watching is around $208, based on a technical analysis called Ichimoku.\n\nThat level \u201cis a more likely point for the correction to mature,\u201d Stockton said. \u201cWe obviously don\u2019t have a crystal ball, but based on where they currently stand, it looks like we\u2019ll see the 200-day moving average taken out and progress toward that secondary support.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple is scheduled to report quarterly earnings Jan. 30 after markets close, a major catalyst for shares that investors will be closely watching. Wall Street expects the iPhone maker to report earnings per share of $2.35 on $124.2 billion in revenue.\n\nOf course, Apple shares could just test the 200-day moving average level and rebound higher, especially if it reports earnings that beat analyst expectations. While the 200-day is a key psychological level that can be a warning sign for stocks, some traders may also use it as an indicator to start buying shares at a discount.\n\n\u201cYou could have buyers who maybe set the 200-day level as a spot to add more exposure,\u201d said Sohn. \u201cSo then the question becomes; if you hold here, can Apple rally back to $260?\u201d\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nForget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations The CDC Won\u2019t Give the Public a Full Picture of Fertility Treatment Risks How Kendrick Lamar Turned Beef With Drake Into Music Superstardom Elon Musk\u2019s Inaugural Highs (and Lows) Greek Police Say Eggs Were Stolen from IVF Clinic Patients\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments",

                "reasoning": "The news paints a bearish picture for Apple in the short term. The stock is underperforming, approaching its 200-day moving average (a key support level), and analysts are suggesting further declines if this level is breached. The negative sentiment is compounded by the fact that Apple has been eclipsed by Nvidia in market capitalization. While a positive earnings report could reverse the trend, the article emphasizes the potential for further downside, especially if the 200-day moving average is broken. The S&P 500's resilience despite Apple's struggles is also mentioned, but the article warns that a broader tech selloff could exacerbate the situation. The technical analysis points towards a potential drop to $208 if the 200-day moving average is breached. Given these factors, the probability of a further fall seems higher than a rise, at least in the short term, until earnings are released."

Technical analysts like Stockton anticipate further declines, potentially to around $208, if this level is breached.  However, Sohn points out that the 200-day moving average can also attract buyers looking for a discount.  The upcoming earnings report on January 30th is a major catalyst that could significantly impact the stock price.  A beat could trigger a rebound, while a miss could exacerbate the decline. Considering the bearish technical indicators, the negative year-to-date performance, and the potential for further downside if the 200-day moving average is broken, the probability of a price fall is higher than a price rise in the short term. However, the possibility of a positive earnings surprise and subsequent buying pressure cannot be ignored."

        "content": "Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) remains a Buy at BofA Securities, though analysts trimmed the price target to $253 from $256, citing a weaker iPhone outlook. Despite this, the firm sees earnings resiliency as a key strength heading into Apple's January 30 earnings report. BofA expects a strong fiscal Q1, with $126 billion in revenue and 79 million iPhone shipments, slightly ahead of Wall Street's 77 million estimate.\n\nHowever, Q2 could be weaker, with BofA lowering its iPhone forecast to 49 million units from 56 million, citing macro pressures and slower adoption of Apple Intelligence features. Beyond hardware, Services remains a bright spot, with 13% growth expected in Q1 and 14% for the rest of the year. App Store revenue jumped 15% year-over-year, signaling strong demand.\n\nAnalysts also believe China concerns are overblown and expect Trump's administration to ease regulatory pressures from the EU and U.S. Department of Justice.

The lowered price target reflects the Q2 concerns, but the overall tone remains bullish.  The probability of a price rise is higher because the positive factors (strong Q1, Services growth, potential margin improvement) outweigh the negative (weaker Q2 iPhone sales).

        "content": "The \"Magnificent 7\" are set to dominate earnings focus in the coming week, as five of these tech giants are due to report, though there are still a number of other big names releasing results.\n\nTesla (TSLA), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) will be releasing results next week, attracting plenty of investor attention.\n\nMarkets will also be watching what US president Donald Trump has on the policy agenda for his second week back in office.\n\nIn terms of other earnings due out in the coming week, investors will be looking closely at the full-year results from ASML, as it manufactures lithography machines that are key to making chips and so is used to help gauge semiconductor demand.\n\nRead more: What to look out for from Mag 7 earnings, including Nvidia and Tesla\n\nChipmaker Intel (INTC) is due to report, as the company continues its search for a new CEO.\n\nFollowing some positive news in the luxury sector, investors will be hoping LVMH's results can add to optimism.\n\nShell's latest quarterly results come as oil prices come under renewed pressure from comments by newly reinstated US president Donald Trump on lowering prices.\n\nMerger rumours have been swirling around miner Glencore, which is due to release its year-end production report in the coming week.\n\nHere's more on what to look for:\n\nASML (ASML.AS) \u2014 Releases fourth quarter and full-year results on Wednesday 29 January\n\nDutch company ASML is considered a bellweather for the global chip industry, so it's full-year results is likely to draw much market focus.\n\nInvestors were rattled in October when the company released its results a day early, which was attributed to a \"technical error\".\n\nIn addition, ASML cut its net sales forecast for 2025, which saw shares tumble.\n\nChristophe Fouquet, CEO of ASML, said that the company expected total net sales of between \u20ac30bn (\u00a325bn) and \u20ac35bn for 2025, \"which is the lower half of the range that we provided at our 2022 Investor Day\".\n\nHe said that the company expected its gross margin to come in between 51% and 53%, which was also below the range it provided in 2022. Fouquet said this was \"mainly related to the delayed timing of EUV [extreme ultraviolet lithography] demand\".\n\nRead more: Best fund picks for investing in a Trump 2.0 presidency\n\nAs for its results in the third quarter, ASML delivered total net sales of \u20ac7.5bn, which was up on the previous quarter. For the full 2024 fiscal year, ASML said it expected total net sales of around \u20ac28bn.\n\nSince October's results release, ASML stock has struggled to regain ground, leaving it just less than 2% in the green over the past year.\n\nStory Continues\n\nTrump's approach to chip export policies is likely to be a key consideration for the company and the industry more broadly, given the Biden administration's efforts already to limit China's access to the technology.\n\nDutch prime minister Dick Schoof said in an interview with Bloomberg at the World Economic Forum in Davos that he expected Trump to keep pushing to restrict ASML's exports of machines to China.\n\n\u201cThe Biden administration pushed very hard and I expect the Trump administration pushing the same way,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(ASML.AS)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nIntel (INTC) \u2014 Releases fourth quarter on Thursday 30 January\n\nChipmaker Intel has suffered a series of struggles, which saw its shares sink last year and has left them down 55% on a one-year basis.\n\nBack in August, Pat Gelsinger, who was ousted from his role as Intel CEO last month, announced \"significant actions\" to reduce costs. He said the firm planned to deliver $10bn (\u00a38bn) in cost savings in 2025, which included reducing the company's head count by around 15,000 roles.\n\nIn the third quarter, Intel beat expectations on revenue, which came in at $13.28bn, versus estimates of $13bn. However, the company posted a loss per share of $0.46, which was much worse than analyst expectations of $0.03.\n\nRead more: Stocks that are trending today\n\nAt the same time, positive fourth quarter guidance and a beat on data center revenue, lifted Intel's shares.\n\nIntel said it expects revenue to come in at between $13.3bn and $14.3bn for the fourth quarter, versus Wall Street estimates of $13.6bn.\n\nGelsinger then announced his exit in December and the company's board appointed two temporary co-CEOs.\n\nThe company's board has also brought on two semiconductor experts, former ASML CEO Eric Meurice and Microchip (MCHP) chairman Steve Sanghi.\n\nYahoo Finance reported that there were a number of candidates at the centre of conversations to take on the role, though insiders said there were no clear frontrunners yet.\n\nMeanwhile, SemiAccurate recently reported that a mystery company is trying to acquire the company as a whole. A spokesperson for Intel declined to comment on the report.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(INTC)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nLVMH (MC.PA) \u2014 Releases full-year results on Tuesday 28 January\n\nLuxury stocks rallied on the back of Cartier-owner Richemont's (CFR.SW) latest trading update, which reported a surge in sales in the third quarter.\n\nThis sparked hopes of a turnaround for the luxury sector, which has been out of fashion with investor for some time. Companies have struggled as rising cost pressures on consumers forced them to rein in spending and brands have been particularly impacted by the economic slowdown in China.\n\nHowever, Richemont's trading update lifted investor spirits and the share prices of Paris listed companies LVMH, Kering (KER.PA) and Herm\u00e8s (RMS.PA), as well as iconic British brand Burberry (BRBY.L) and Hong Kong-listed Italian company Prada (1913.HK).\n\nBurberry's third quarter update, released on Friday, added to optimism, after it reported better-than-expected festive sales.\n\nThis drove Burberry shares to surge nearly 13% on Friday morning, while Kering gained nearly 9% and LVMH was up 3%.\n\nRead more: 6 crypto developments in 2025 that will keep fuelling bitcoin's rally\n\nAttention will now turn to LVMH's full-year results on Tuesday 28 January, with hopes that it will have seen some improvement since its third quarter results.\n\nLVMH reported a 3% drop in revenue in the third quarter to \u20ac19.08bn, dragging shares lower.\n\n\"It\u2019s been a tough period for luxury powerhouse, LVMH, with sales coming under pressure and missing market forecasts by a wide margin last quarter,\" said Aarin Chiekrie, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown (HL.L).\n\n\"Price hikes in the Fashion and Leather goods division weren\u2019t enough to offset falling volumes, and Wines & Spirits continued to struggle against a backdrop of weak Chinese demand.\"\n\nHowever, Chiekrie said that the recent excitement around Richemonth had buoyed stocks in the stock, \"helping LVMH regain its spot as Europe\u2019s most valuable company.\"\n\n\"But whether LVMH can retain this crown will depend somewhat on its ability to meet market expectations, which are looking for full-year revenue to fall by no more than 2.2% to \u20ac84.3bn from next week\u2019s results, before returning to growth the following year.\"\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(MC.PA)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nShell (SHEL.L) \u2014 Releases fourth quarter results on Thursday 30 January\n\nOil prices remain under pressure, with existing concerns about reduced demand, while comments from newly reinstated US president Trump have dragged on the commodity.\n\nIn a speech made remotely to the World Economic Forum at Davos, Trump said that he would ask the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), led by Saudi Arabia, to bring down the price of oil.\n\n\"I'm also going to ask Saudi Arabia and OPEC to bring down the cost of oil. You've got to bring it down,\" he said.\n\nThis prompted oil prices to slide, with brent crude (BZ=F) dipping back below $78 a barrel.\n\nDerren Nathan, head of equity research at Hargreaves Lansdown, said brent crude \"obediently followed president Trump\u2019s calls for lower oil prices\".\n\n\"However, there are signs of industry resistance building to his mandate to 'drill baby drill',\" he said.\n\nRead more: FTSE housing stocks set to benefit from property market rebound\n\n\"Such a move could undermine profitability for the industry and Rystad Energy and Wood Mackenzie are now forecasting that total US oil output in Trump\u2019s second term will rise by less than 1.3 million barrels a day. For now, a ninth consecutive fall in US inventories suggests that supply remains tight meaning that further dips in the price can\u2019t be assured.\"\n\nOil major Shell attributed its dip in earnings in the third quarter to lower refining margins, lower realised oil prices and higher operating expenses.\n\nShell reported that adjusted earnings fell by 4% on the second quarter from nearly $6.3bn, though this was strongly ahead of expectations.\n\nCommenting separately, Nathan said that Shell's recent trading statement \"revealed that while most business units have been trading broadly in line with previous guidance, the production and liquification ranges for integrated gas has been lowered.\n\n\"These are set to come in below third quarter levels, reflecting planned maintenance at its processing facility in Qatar, as well as the timing of shipments from offshore gas fields,\" he said. \"The weakness should be partially offset by an improved outlook for corporate costs.\"\n\nNathan added that investors will also be looking out for any comments on shareholder distributions, given Shell has announced buybacks of at least $3bn in each of the last 12 quarters.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(SHEL.L)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nGlencore (GLEN.L) \u2014 Releases year-end production report on Thursday 30 January\n\nShares in miner Glencore recently ticked higher on reports that it had held early-stage talks with Rio Tinto (RIO.L) over a potential merger.\n\nReuters reported that that Glencore approached Rio Tinto late last year with a merger proposition but that discussions did not progress.\n\nIn addition, the report said that a Glencore spokesperson said the company was open to merger and acquisition transactions that create value for shareholders.\n\nStocks: Create your watchlist and portfolio\n\nSpokespeople for Glencore and Rio Tinto had not responded to Yahoo Finance UK's request for comment at the time of writing.\n\nGlencore reported lower production for copper, cobalt, zinc, nickel and thermal coal in the first nine months of the year.\n\nHowever, the miner said its outlook remained unchanged for 2024 overall for copper production, expecting between 950,000 and 1.01 million tonnes.\n\nGlencore also said it continued to expect marketing adjusted earnings before interest and tax for the full-year to be in the range of $3bn to $3.5bn. Glencore CEO Gary Nagle highlighted that this was around the top end of its long-term guidance range of $2.2bn to $3.2bn per annum.\n\nFollowing the release of Glencore's year-end production report next week, the company's preliminary annual results for 2024 are then due out on 19 February.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(GLEN.L)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nOther companies reporting next week include:\n\nMonday 27 January\n\nDr Martens (DOCS.L)\n\nFanuc 6954 (6954.T)\n\nRyanair (RYA.IR)\n\nAT&T (T)\n\nNucor (NUE)\n\nSofi Technologies (SOFI)\n\nSanmina (SANM)\n\nTuesday 28 January\n\nIdox (IDOX.L)\n\nAG Barr (BAG.L)\n\nHarworth Group (HWG.L)\n\nPets at Home (PETS.L)\n\nSSP Group (SSPG.L)\n\nSThree (STEM.L)\n\nSAP (SAP)\n\nAtlas Copco (ATLPF)\n\nLogitech (LOGI)\n\nRTX (RTX)\n\nStryker (SYK)\n\nBoeing (BA)\n\nLockheed Martin (LMT)\n\nChubb (CB)\n\nStarbucks (SBUX)\n\nRoyal Caribbean Cruise (RCL)\n\nGeneral Motors Co (GM)\n\nKimberly Clark (KMB)\n\nArcher Daniels Midland adm (ADM)\n\nPackaging Corporation of America (PKG)\n\nF5 Networks (FFIV)\n\nQorvo (QRVO)\n\nWednesday 29 January\n\nAJ Bell (AJB.L)\n\nHardide (HDD.L)\n\nHargreaves Services (HSP.L)\n\nWH Smith (SMWH.L)\n\nMeta (META)\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT)\n\nTesla (TSLA)\n\nAdvantest (6857.T)\n\nAlibaba (9988.HK)\n\nTata Motors (TATAMOTORS.NS)\n\nVolvo AB (VOLV-B.ST)\n\nWH Smith (SMWH.L)\n\nT-Mobile USA (TMUS)\n\nIBM (IBM)\n\nQualcomm (QCOM)\n\nDanaher (DHR)\n\nLAM Research (LRCX)\n\nGeneral Dynamics (GD)\n\nNorfolk Southern (NSC)\n\nUnited Rentals (URI)\n\nHess (HESM)\n\nCorning (OC)\n\nOtis Worldwide (OTIS)\n\nRockwell (ROK)\n\nTeradyne (TER)\n\nWestern Digital (WDC)\n\nSkyworks (SWKS)\n\nThursday 30 January\n\n3i Group (III.L)\n\nAmazon (AMZN)\n\nApple (AAPL)\n\nBaker Hughes (BKR)\n\nBT Group (BT-A.L)\n\nCaterpillar (CAT)\n\nCVS Group (CVSG.L)\n\nGlencore (GLEN.L)\n\nMastercard (MA)\n\nSage Group (SGE.L)\n\nShell (SHEL.L)\n\nSt James's Place (STJ.L)\n\nVisa (V)\n\nWizz Air Holdings (WIZZ.L)\n\nAirtel Africa (AAF.L)\n\nRank (RNK.L)\n\nTakeda Pharmaceuticals (4502.T)\n\nAdani Ports (ADANIPORTS.NS)\n\nRoche (ROG.SW)\n\nSanofi (SAN.PA)\n\nABB (ABT)\n\nBBVA (BBVA)\n\nCaixa Bank (CABK.MC)\n\nMastercard (MA)\n\nCaterpillar (CAT)\n\nComcast (CMCSA)\n\nUPS (UPS)\n\nAltria (MO)\n\nKLA-Tencor (KLAC)\n\nCigna (CI)\n\nFerrari RACE (RACE)\n\nNorthrop Grumman (NTH.DU)\n\nMicrochip (MCHP)\n\nL3 Harris (LHX.MX)\n\nDow (DOW)\n\nFriday 31 January\n\nChevron Corp (CVX)\n\nFujitsu 6702 (6702.T)\n\nKomatsu (6301.T)\n\nTDK (6762.T)\n\nMitsui OSK (5273.T)\n\nSamsung Electronics (005930.KS)\n\nNovartis (NOVN.SW)\n\nExxonMobil xom (XOM)\n\nAbbVie (ABBV)\n\nConocoPhillips (COP)\n\nAON (AON)\n\nPhillips 66 (PSX)\n\nLyondellBasell (LYB)\n\nYou can read Yahoo Finance's full calendar here.\n\nRead more:\n\nKey investment themes to watch in 2025 Will cocoa and other commodities rally in 2025?

Given the focus on earnings from the 'Magnificent 7' and the potential for positive or negative surprises, there is a balanced outlook.

While the overall market sentiment and Trump's policies could influence the broader market, the primary driver for Apple's stock price will be its earnings report. Without specific details about expectations or potential surprises, it's difficult to lean heavily in either direction. I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price rise, assuming that being part of the 'Magnificent 7' and the general positive sentiment around tech stocks will provide a slight tailwind. However, the lack of concrete information about Apple's expected performance keeps the probability from being significantly higher."

Positive results from these companies could boost investor confidence and lead to a rise in Apple's stock price, while negative results could have the opposite effect.  President Trump's return to office and potential policy changes, particularly regarding chip exports, introduce uncertainty.  This uncertainty could lead to either increased risk aversion (causing a fall) or increased speculation (causing a rise), depending on the market's interpretation of his actions.

According to S&P Global, in the past 30 years up until June 2021, the Dow index returned approximately 11.16% compared to the market\u2019s return of 10.6%. This growth is mainly due to the Dow\u2019s stable, industry-leading companies that offer reliable dividends and returns.\n\nREAD ALSO: 7 Most Undervalued Financial Stocks To Buy According to Analysts.\n\nSince the beginning of 2025, Dow Jones has soared over 4% as mega-cap tech stocks surged following their positive earnings.

The $500 billion Stargate AI infrastructure project led by Oracle, OpenAI, and SoftBank will accelerate the AI demand. Tech stocks are already dominating the market driven by the huge demand for AI. Nasdaq Composite returned nearly 30% in 2024, outperforming the Dow and the S&P 500.\n\nThe U.S. economy is expected to perform better this year compared to 2024 followed by lower interest rates and PCE inflation expected around 2.1%.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNo. of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that designs, manufactures, and markets smartphones, PCs, watches, wearables, and related accessories. Over the past years, the iPhone maker has enhanced its Services business segment with major products including Apple Wallet and Apple Pay, which allows users to manage payments from their Apple systems.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has solidified its long-term dominance in the consumer electronics sector while concentrating on a high-end, intricately linked ecosystem of goods, services, and software. Apple\u2019s iPhone which generates 46% of the company\u2019s net sales continues to hold its market. Retaining consumers in this interlinked ecosystem of Apple allows the company to expand its network and maximize its earnings.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, the company reported record revenue of $94.9 billion, a rise of 6% from a year ago. The sales growth was driven by strong iPhone revenue, which accounted for $46.2 billion, setting a record for the September quarter across all geographic areas. Apple\u2019s services sector continues to grow as the firm reported over 1 billion paid memberships in Q4. The services revenue also reached a record high of $25 billion, up 12% year-over-year.\n\nCDT Capital Management stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cThe crowd. While this evolution in AI is going to change the world, market expectations for the technology have become unhinged. The crowd, which is more like an exuberant mob, anointed the Mag 7 with spectacular, nonsensical valuations based on the premise that AI will be an amazing, money-printing growth engine for these companies \u2013 and the truth is it likely will be. The problem is that the math just isn\u2019t mathing.\u201d\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 5th on our list of best Dow stocks to buy right now. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

On the other hand, the article suggests that other AI stocks may offer higher returns in a shorter timeframe, and that AAPL is ranked 5th on their list of best Dow stocks. The article also mentions that the market expectations for the Mag 7 are unhinged.

However, the article's main focus is on comparing Apple to other Dow stocks, particularly those with higher exposure to the AI boom.  While acknowledging Apple's positive performance and its position as a top 5 Dow stock to buy, the article expresses more bullish sentiment towards AI stocks, suggesting that they offer greater potential for higher and faster returns.  The inclusion of CDT Capital Management's quote expressing caution about overvalued AI stocks introduces a degree of uncertainty.  Overall, the news is positive for Apple but doesn't provide a strong impetus for significant price movement in either direction. The article's comparative analysis suggests a slightly higher probability of other stocks outperforming Apple, rather than Apple specifically experiencing a price surge."

The change in CMA leadership adds another layer of uncertainty, although the government claims independence will be maintained. The overall tone suggests a negative impact, albeit potentially limited to the UK market. The market's reaction will depend on the perceived severity of the potential interventions and the overall market sentiment towards tech regulation. Given the potential for reduced control and profitability, a slight downward pressure on the stock price is more likely than a rise in the short term.

The news also comes amidst a change in leadership at the CMA, adding uncertainty to the potential outcome.

        "content": "The latest earnings season has gotten off to a strong start, with investor attention turning to the \"Magnificent 7\" tech giants to see if their results can add to this momentum.\n\nThe major tech stocks led market gains in 2024 and the question for investors now is whether they can continue to do so in 2025.\n\nMore specifically, the Magnificent 7 \u2014 Tesla, Meta, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Nvidia \u2014 were responsible for more than half of the S&P 500\u2019s (^GSPC) 25% return in 2024.\n\nTech stocks were already poised to climb higher this year, with Donald Trump's return to the White House, given his pledges to loosen regulations and cut taxes, as well as to invest heavily in AI.\n\nBillionaire tech CEOs have also been flocking to forge closer ties with Trump, with many in attendance at his inauguration.\n\nRead more: Best fund picks for investing in a Trump 2.0 presidency\n\nIn the first few days of Trump's second presidential term tech stocks rallied, after he unveiled a $500bn (\u00a3405bn) private-sector investment plan \u2014 known as the \"Stargate\" project \u2014 to build AI infrastructure in the US.\n\nIn a note on Wednesday, John Higgins, chief markets economist at Capital Economics, said: \"Trump\u2019s ringing endorsement of Stargate is another shot in the arm for AI in the early days of his second presidency, and supports our long-standing view that the S&P 500 will thrive in 2025 amid growing investment in, and enthusiasm for, this transformative technology.\"\n\nGiven this theme is set to continue to dominate markets this year, investors will be watching to see which of the Mag 7 stocks are leading the way on the AI trend, or if any are falling behind.\n\nHere's what experts expect to see from the Mag 7 this earnings season.\n\nTesla (TSLA) \u2014 reports on Wednesday 29 January\n\nShares in electric vehicle (EV) maker Tesla have surged since Trump's election victory in November, with the stock becoming known as part of the \"Trump trade\", as CEO Elon Musk has become a close ally of the president.\n\nMusk, who was a major supporter of Trump campaign, was appointed to lead the new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).\n\nThe rally in Tesla shares comes despite the company reporting an annual delivery decline in early January for the first time in more than a decade. Tesla delivered 1.78 million vehicles in 2024, which was below analyst estimates of 1.8 million.\n\nTesla shares fell following the release of these figures and while Musk's expected role of influence on the incoming Trump administration saw the stock rise ahead of the inauguration, it fell back on the first full day of trading after the Republican president returned to office.\n\nStory Continues\n\nRead more: Stocks that are trending today\n\nThis came after Trump revoked a policy that mandated half of the new US cars manufactured be electric by 2030 and directed his administration to consider eliminating \"unfair subsidies\" on EVs.\n\nMusk had said last year that he didn't think Tesla would be as impacted as competitors by the scrapping of subsidies and believed it could even help the company in the long term.\n\nDespite these headwinds, analysts remain confident about the stock. Piper Sandler analyst Alexander Potter said he believed that Tesla would shift away from launching new EVs and focus on \"popularising\" its autonomous driving software, changing his price target on the stock to $500 from $315.\n\nIn terms of financial performance, Tesla posted third quarter revenue of $25.18bn, which was below estimates of $25.4bn. However, adjusted earnings per share of $0.72 came in ahead of an anticipated $0.60, and Tesla's closely-watched gross margin figure came in at 19.8%, much higher than the 16.8% expected.\n\nAs for Tesla outlook, the company said in its quarterly earnings deck that plans for new vehicles, including more affordable models, \"remain on track for start of production in the first half of 2025\".\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(TSLA)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nMeta (META) \u2014 reports on Wednesday 29 January\n\nMark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Facebook-owner Meta, is another tech leader that has been trying to build a closer relationship with Trump.\n\nMeta committed $1m to Trump's inaugural fund and recently announced it had appointed Ultimate Fighting Championship CEO Dana White, an ally of Trump, as one of three new board members.\n\nZuckerberg also recently announced an end to the company's third-party fact-checking programme in the US, a move that was considered as part of a repositioning ahead of Trump's return to office.\n\nMeta shares are up 62% over the past year, though the stock fell following the release of its third quarter earnings in October.\n\nThe company delivered earnings per share of $6.03, which bested estimates of $5.25 and revenue of $40.5bn beat forecasts of $40.2bn.\n\nRead more: 6 crypto developments in 2025 that will keep fuelling bitcoin's rally\n\nHowever, expectations were high going into this set of results and Meta guided to fourth quarter revenue guidance of between $45bn and $48bn for the quarter, compared to analyst forecasts of $46.09bn. The company also said it expects capital expenses to grow significantly in 2025.\n\nMatt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \"Meta has set itself apart among tech giants by turning AI investments into quick wins. Unlike cloud providers that sell AI capabilities, Meta focuses its efforts on enhancing its own products, driving higher ad revenue.\"\n\n\"That\u2019s not to say the AI push comes cheap,\" he added. \"Zuckerberg sees AI as a once-in-a-generation opportunity, and the spending reflects that ambition.

There were concerns around pressure on company profit margins in second quarter given the ramp up in AI spending.\n\nShares have had a bumpy ride over the past year, capping gains at nearly 12%.\n\nBritzman said that the key metric to watch in the second quarter results was growth in its cloud computing Azure business, which is expected to come in at 31% to 32%.\n\n\"Microsoft has said more recently that its capacity constraints are resolved, so markets hope to get a better picture of current demand levels in the coming quarters,\" he said. \"Beyond Azure, the rollout of Copilot will also be under scrutiny, with investors eager to see how product development and adoption are progressing after some criticism from peers.\"\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(MSFT)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nApple (AAPL) \u2014 reports on Thursday 30 January\n\nShares in Apple have come under pressure recently, amid disappointing news around its iPhone market share.\n\nApple's stock has suffered two analyst rating downgrades this week alone. Jefferies (JEF) analyst Edison Lee lowered the investment bank's rating on Apple shares to \"underperform\" and decreased his price target on the stock by 13% to $200.75.\n\nLee said in an investor note that he expected Apple's first quarter results \u2014 which are due out next week \u2014 to come in below expectations, and for the company to miss against estimates for the second quarter on weak iPhone sales and a lack of interest in AI among consumers.\n\nMeanwhile, Loop Capital downgraded Apple from \"buy\" to \"hold\" and lowered its price target on the stock from $275 to $230.\n\nMeanwhile, Counterpoint Research found sales of Apple's iPhones fell 18.2% in China in the December quarter, according to a Bloomberg report.

In November, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) asked that Google be forced to sell off its Chrome browser, as part of proposed remedies aimed at ending the company's dominance in internet search.\n\nThis filing came after a judge ruled in favour of prosecutors in a landmark trial in August, who argued that that Google ran its search engine empire as an illegal monopoly.

        "headline": "Trump opens a divide between US and EU over Big Tech",
        "content": "President Trump on Thursday called out the European Union for its antitrust battles with American tech giants, saying the billions of dollars in fines they've levied against US companies amount to a tax on American corporations.\n\nTrump made the comments during a virtual appearance at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, during which he laid out plans for his second term and took questions from the likes of Bank of America\u2019s Brian Moynihan and Santander\u2019s Ana Bot\u00edn.\n\n\u201cThey took court cases with Apple, and they supposedly won a case that most people didn\u2019t think was much of a case, they won $15 billion or $16 billion from Apple. They won billions from Google. I think they\u2019re after Facebook for billions and billions,\u201d Trump said about the bloc\u2019s regulators.\n\n\u201cThese are American companies, whether you like them or not, they are American companies, and they shouldn\u2019t be doing that. And as far as I\u2019m concerned, it\u2019s a form of taxation,\u201d he added.\n\nThe EU has been aggressively tackling the power of American tech companies for years. Most recently, the bloc fined Apple (AAPL) 13 billion euros over back taxes owed to Ireland. The fee hit Apple\u2019s bottom line in Q4, pulling lower its earnings per share from $1.64 to $0.97.\n\nIn March 2024, the EU fined Apple $2 billion as part of the company\u2019s long-running battle with Spotify for allegedly \u201cabusing its dominant position on the market for the distribution of music streaming apps.\u201dEuropean Commissioner for Europe fit for the Digital Age Margrethe Vestager speaks during a media conference regarding an antitrust case against Google Adtech at EU headquarters in Brussels, Wednesday, June 14, 2023. (AP Photo/Virginia Mayo)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nGoogle (GOOG, GOOGL) lost a legal battle with the EU in September, forcing the company to pay $2.7 billion for using its price comparison tool to disadvantage European services. Google also continues to fight a 2011 antitrust case over its Android operating system, which the EU says the company uses to impose \u201cillegal restrictions on Android device manufacturers and mobile network operators to cement its dominant position in general internet search.\u201d\n\nIn November, the EU fined Meta (META) 797 million euros over claims that it breached antitrust rules through its Facebook Marketplace service. The bloc also fined Meta $1.3 billion in 2023 over claims that it violated data protection rules in the region.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) haven\u2019t escaped the EU\u2019s sights, either. The collection of European economies threatened Amazon with antitrust fines of $47 billion, forcing the company to change its business practices in the EU. The regulator recently issued a statement of objections to Microsoft over its decision to tie its Teams software to its Office 365 and Microsoft 365 productivity suites.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAmerica\u2019s tech battles\n\nThe EU isn't the only government body taking issue with US tech firms. The US is also battling Big Tech in the courtroom over dozens of alleged antitrust violations.\n\nAfter winning a landmark antitrust case against Google\u2019s search business in August, the Department of Justice in November signaled it wanted to break up the tech giant. Google is appealing the decision.\n\nThe DOJ has also filed an antitrust suit against Apple, alleging that it operates as an illegal monopoly by making it difficult for customers to switch from iPhone to competing devices and putting restrictions on app developers and app distribution.Former-FTC Chairwoman Lina Khan filed antitrust suits against Meta and Amazon. (Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images)\u00b7Tom Williams via Getty Images\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission has also filed antitrust lawsuits against Amazon and Meta. In the Amazon suit, the FTC alleges the e-commerce retailer wields its enormous power to disadvantage other retailers via anti-discounting measures.\n\nIt further alleges that Amazon requires sellers to use its fulfillment service to gain access to the company\u2019s Prime service, making it more expensive for those sellers to offer their goods on other platforms.\n\nIn the Meta case, set for trial in 2025, the FTC claims the social media company ran an illegal \u201cbuy-or-bury\u201d scheme to either purchase or crush competing social platforms. The FTC is calling for Meta to unwind its acquisitions of both Instagram and WhatsApp.\n\nThe FTC initially brought its case against Meta under the Trump administration, but Lina Khan, the FTC chair for the Biden administration, refiled it after that initial dismissal.\n\nTrump\u2019s tech turnaround\n\nAhead of the 2024 election, Big Tech CEOs sought to cozy up to Trump, with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg praising the then-candidate\u2019s reaction to an assassination attempt in July 2024. Trump had previously threatened to jail Zuckerberg in his book.Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk attend the inauguration of Donald Trump. (Photo by Saul Loeb-Pool/Getty Images)\u00b7Pool via Getty Images\n\nAmazon founder Jeff Bezos has also come out in support of Trump, with Amazon donating $1 million to his inauguration campaign. Bezos and Trump had an acrimonious relationship during Trump\u2019s first term with Trump criticizing Bezos over the Washington Post's reporting about him. Bezos owns the Post.\n\nAhead of the election, Bezos prevented the Post\u2019s editorial board from endorsing Trump\u2019s rival, former Vice President Kamala Harris, for president.\n\nGoogle and Microsoft also donated $1 million to Trump\u2019s inauguration, as did Apple CEO Tim Cook and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.\n\nAltman, Bezos, Cook, Zuckerberg, and Google CEO Sundar Pichai each attended Trump\u2019s inauguration Monday, sitting just behind Trump\u2019s lectern while other Republican leaders viewed the proceedings from an overflow area.\n\nWith Big Tech working to gain Trump\u2019s favor and the president openly defending them against EU antitrust matters, there\u2019s a chance that the companies could enjoy a far more forgiving regulatory environment for the next four years.Sign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter.\u00b7yahoofinance\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

However, the article also highlights ongoing antitrust scrutiny in the US, including a DOJ lawsuit against Apple, which is a negative. The article also mentions past fines levied by the EU which negatively impacted Apple's EPS. The fact that Big Tech CEOs are cozying up to Trump suggests they anticipate a more favorable regulatory environment, which is generally positive. Considering these factors, the positive aspects slightly outweigh the negatives, but the US antitrust suit creates uncertainty.

                "reasoning": "The news focuses on Trump's criticism of EU antitrust actions against US tech companies, including Apple's significant fine. While Trump's stance might suggest a potentially more favorable regulatory environment for Apple under a hypothetical second Trump term, several factors complicate a simple prediction.  The news itself is not directly about Apple's financial performance or product announcements, which are typically stronger drivers of stock price.  The EU fines are already reflected in Apple's Q4 earnings, so the news is largely reiterating past events.  Trump's support for Big Tech is also potentially offset by ongoing antitrust investigations within the US.  Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be muted.  A slight positive bias is introduced due to the potential for reduced future regulatory pressure under a Trump administration, but this is uncertain and heavily dependent on the election outcome. The probabilities reflect this uncertainty and the limited direct impact of the news."

This could signal a more favorable regulatory environment under a potential second Trump term, reducing future financial penalties and legal risks for Apple. However, the immediate impact of the EU's recent fines (e.g., $13 billion and $2 billion) has already negatively affected Apple's earnings (Q4 EPS dropped from $1.64 to $0.97). The market may react positively to the prospect of reduced regulatory pressure in the future, but the short-term financial hit from existing fines could weigh on the stock. Overall, the balance leans slightly positive due to political support outweighing past penalties."

However, the article is behind a paywall, so the full context and details from Morgan Stanley are unavailable. Without knowing the specific estimates and the nuances of Morgan Stanley's analysis, it's difficult to make a definitive prediction. A slight rise is possible if the market was expecting worse, but a slight fall is also possible if the market was hoping for better. I'm assigning slightly higher probability to a fall because the market often prices in expectations, and 'in-line' results might be seen as slightly disappointing."

        "content": "We recently published a list of Billionaire Dan Loeb\u2019s Top Stock Picks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other Billionaire Dan Loeb\u2019s top stock picks.\n\nDan Loeb is an American billionaire, activist investor, and hedge fund manager best known as the founder and CEO of Third Point, a New York-based hedge fund. Known for his bold activist strategies, sharp letters to corporate boards, and remarkable investment acumen, Loeb has become one of the most influential figures in the hedge fund industry. His ability to identify undervalued companies, implement changes to unlock value, and deliver strong returns for investors has solidified his reputation as a financial powerhouse. He was born in 1961 in California. Coming from an affluent family, his father was a partner at a prominent law firm, and his mother was a historian. Loeb attended the University of California, Berkeley, where he initially studied at the business school before transferring to the College of Letters and Science. He graduated with a degree in economics in 1983.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nLoeb\u2019s early career in finance saw him working at Warburg Pincus in private equity and later at Citigroup in risk arbitrage. These roles provided him with the foundation to understand markets, value creation, and capital allocation. In 1995, Loeb launched Third Point LLC with $3.3 million in capital, including $300,000 of his own money. The firm initially operated as a scrappy startup but quickly grew in prominence thanks to Loeb\u2019s exceptional returns and his willingness to engage in public activist campaigns. As of the end of the third quarter of 2024, Third Point manages over $7.4 billion in 13F securities. Third Point has delivered double-digit annualized returns since its inception, with Loeb\u2019s keen investment instincts driving its success. Loeb takes large, concentrated positions in companies he believes can be turned around.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nFor this article, we selected stocks by combing through the 13F portfolio of Third Point at the end of the third quarter of 2024. These stocks are also popular among other hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nStory Continues\n\nIs Apple Inc. (AAPL) Among Billionaire Dan Loeb\u2019s Top Stock Picks?\n\nDan Loeb of Third Point\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nThird Point\u2019s Stake: $216.7 million\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. There are several compelling factors that make this company a strong investment. Firstly, as per the reports for the third quarter of 2024, the company generated nearly $27 billion in operating cash flow, which reflects strong financial health. And, the company returned over $29 billion to shareholders, demonstrating the company\u2019s commitment to maximizing shareholder value. Secondly, the company\u2019s commitment to a $100 million pledge, including a first-of-its-kind education hub for HBCUs and an Apple Developer Academy in Detroit, reflects a long-term strategy for talent development. This would drive future innovation, enhance brand loyalty, and support sustainable growth. Moreover, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) commits to protecting the planet by focusing on recycled and renewable materials, clean electricity, and low-carbon shipping. This vision for 2030 would bring net emissions to zero across the company\u2019s entire carbon footprint.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 12th on our list of Billionaire Dan Loeb\u2019s top stock picks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

(AAPL) is among the top stock picks of billionaire investor Dan Loeb, which typically signals positive sentiment and potential investor interest. Additionally, AAPL's strong financial performance, including significant operating cash flow and shareholder returns, supports a bullish outlook. However, the article also suggests that there are other stocks with potentially higher returns, which may temper enthusiasm for AAPL. Overall, the combination of positive recognition from a prominent investor and solid financials leads to a higher probability of the stock price rising, while the mention of better alternatives introduces some uncertainty."

This suggests confidence in the company. The article also highlights Apple's strong financial health (high operating cash flow, shareholder returns), commitment to talent development, and sustainability initiatives, all of which are positive factors. However, the article also states that Apple ranks 12th among Loeb's top picks, implying that he sees other stocks with potentially higher returns. The article also promotes other AI stocks as potentially better investments. Overall, the news is mildly positive, but the comparison to other potentially better investments tempers the bullish sentiment. Therefore, the probability of a rise is slightly higher than a fall, but not overwhelmingly so."

However, the article explicitly states that AAPL is only the 12th ranked holding out of many, and that the fund believes other stocks offer greater potential for higher returns in a shorter timeframe.  This suggests that while Loeb's investment is positive news, it's not a strong endorsement and doesn't indicate a significant bullish outlook for AAPL specifically. The article highlights Apple's strong financials and commitment to sustainability, which are generally positive factors, but these are already largely known and factored into the stock price.  Therefore, the impact of this news on AAPL's stock price is likely to be minimal. The probability of a price rise is slightly higher than a price fall due to the positive association with a successful investor, but the overall impact is expected to be muted."

Based on this information, the news is generally positive but not exceptionally bullish, as it does not indicate a significant new investment or a dramatic increase in Dan Loeb's stake.

While it could potentially erode Apple's App Store revenue in the long term, the immediate impact is likely to be limited. Apple's ecosystem is deeply entrenched, and users are accustomed to the App Store. The news might create some negative sentiment towards Apple due to increased competition, but the actual financial impact will take time to materialize. The market's reaction will also depend on how aggressively Epic Games can attract users and developers to its platform. Given Apple's strong brand and loyal customer base, a significant immediate drop is unlikely. However, the increased competition introduces a degree of uncertainty, making a slight dip possible."

Apple's App Store generates substantial revenue and is deeply integrated into the iOS ecosystem.

Officials recommended that the applications be pre-installed on Indian-sold handsets and made accessible for download free from warnings including \"untrusted source.\"\n\nGoogle, whose Android operating system runs over 90% of India's around 700 million cellphones, is apparently turning down the demand. Apple is also reported to be reluctant to cooperate. The government has said it could use legal actions or policy directives to compel compliance.\n\nBelieving the GOV.in app suite might increase utilization if combined into a single package in the app stores, the ministry seeks to spread public-welfare services via technology. Right now, Google's Play Store and Apple's App Store each include separate apps.\n\nApple also made a similar action in 2021 in Russia, giving consumers the choice to install government-recommended applications to follow local rules.\n\nTo protect the mobile ecosystem, Google has apparently shown a readiness to work with Indian authorities.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

                "reasoning": "This news presents a mixed bag for Apple. On one hand, the Indian government's request, and potential legal action if unmet, introduces regulatory risk. Forced pre-installation or altered app store warnings could negatively impact user experience and brand perception, potentially leading to a stock price decrease. The comparison to the Russian situation in 2021, where Apple complied with similar demands, suggests a precedent for compliance, which might be viewed negatively by investors concerned about Apple's stance on user privacy and control. On the other hand, the actual financial impact of hosting the app suite is likely minimal. The potential for increased user access to government services could be seen as a positive for the Indian market in the long run, but this is a very indirect benefit. Given Apple's reluctance and the potential for negative publicity if forced to comply, the immediate impact is slightly tilted towards a negative stock price movement. However, the overall impact is likely to be small, as India, while a significant market, is not Apple's largest. The market's reaction will also depend on how Apple navigates the situation and communicates its position to investors."

While this could potentially increase Apple's market share in India in the long term, the immediate impact is likely to be minimal. Apple's reluctance to comply, and the potential for legal action, introduces uncertainty.  However, Apple's previous similar action in Russia suggests a willingness to comply with government regulations, albeit potentially reluctantly. The overall impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be muted, with a slightly higher probability of a minor negative impact due to the potential for regulatory friction and the associated costs and complexities of compliance.  The news is not overwhelmingly positive or negative, and the market may already have priced in similar regulatory risks in other countries."

Apple's reluctance to comply could lead to regulatory challenges in India, a significant growth market. However, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be muted because: (1) India is a smaller market for Apple compared to others like the U.S. and China; (2) Apple has previously complied with similar demands in Russia without major financial repercussions; (3) The news does not directly affect Apple's core revenue streams (iPhone sales, services, etc.). The market may view this as a minor regulatory issue rather than a material risk. Google's resistance is more notable given Android's dominance in India, but Apple's position is less vulnerable."

Apple and Google are reportedly reluctant to comply, and the government may take legal actions or policy directives to compel them. This news has a neutral to slightly negative tone for Apple, as it suggests potential regulatory risks and pressure on the company's app store policies in a significant market. However, given that Apple has navigated similar situations in the past (e.g., in Russia) and the company's strong market position, the immediate impact on the stock price is likely to be limited. The probability of a stock price rise is estimated to be lower due to the potential regulatory overhang, while the probability of a stock price fall is moderate but not extreme, reflecting the uncertainty and potential mitigants."

Apple has previously made similar concessions in Russia, but the situation in India may be different. The Indian government's threat of using legal actions or policy directives to compel compliance could lead to increased regulatory scrutiny, which might negatively impact Apple's stock price. However, the potential benefits of increased public access to government services and the company's willingness to work with authorities could also lead to a positive outcome.

Some will be free to play.\n\nEpic Games\u2019 mobile store debuted in August with its own products, titles such as Fortnite and Rocket League. The company has invested more than $1 billion in its digital storefront for video games and mobile apps, founder and Chief Executive Officer Tim Sweeney said in a meeting with reporters.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re spending more money than we\u2019re making every year because we choose to invest in growth,\u201d he said.\n\nSweeney has been battling in the courts and the marketplace since 2020 to shake the hold over mobile apps held by Apple and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google. While the company has wrung some concessions from the technology leaders, fans still struggle to download the Epic Games Store from devices that use their software.\n\n\u201cApple and Google are making this really hard,\u201d Sweeney said. \u201cWe had a goal of 100 million installs with first-party games. We knew that would be really hard. We ended up at 30 million.\u201d\n\nSweeney blames impediments thrown up by the companies, including pop-ups and other deterrents.\n\nIn 2023, a federal appeals court in California ruled mostly in favor of Apple on allegations by Epic that the iPhone maker\u2019s app store was a monopoly. However, Apple was asked to open up its App Store to outside payment options. Epic won an antitrust case against Google.\n\nApple and Google collected an estimated $23 billion in 2023 from the 30% cut they take from app store sales, according to a report from Matthew Ball, CEO of the investment advisory firm Epyllion.\n\n\u201cThe stores\u2019 fees deprive developers of much-needed margin for reinvestment,\u201d Ball said. \u201cTheir controls have also impeded the development of new experiences and business models that might restore growth and/or create new genres and companies.\u201d\n\nSweeney, whose desktop and mobile store charges a 12% commission, calls the Apple and Google app stores \u201cthe biggest abuse of market power in modern history.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nSo far, Epic said, none of the 100 highest-grossing mobile game developers has been willing to offer titles on the Epic Games Store because of Apple\u2019s Core Technology Fee and other restrictions imposed by the companies.\n\nUnder Apple\u2019s Core Technology Fee, the most popular mobile games may be subject to a download fee when a developer opts to distribute them on an alternative app store. To ease the burden, Epic will cover the cost for all titles from developers that participate in the Epic Games Store\u2019s free games program on iOS or iPadOS devices.\n\n\u201cThe word for spending more money than you\u2019re making when you have a great business underneath is \u2018investment,\u2019\u201d Sweeney said.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nForget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations Green Investors Find a Silver Lining in Trump\u2019s Presidency How Kendrick Lamar Turned Beef With Drake Into Music Superstardom Elon Musk\u2019s Inaugural Highs (and Lows) Greek Police Say Eggs Were Stolen from IVF Clinic Patients\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments",

                "reasoning": "The news highlights Epic Games' ongoing battle with Apple over app store fees and the introduction of third-party games to its mobile marketplace. While this could potentially increase competition and pressure on Apple's app store revenue, the current legal landscape shows that Apple has largely maintained its position, with a recent court ruling favoring them. Additionally, the news does not indicate any immediate negative impact on Apple's core business or financials. Therefore, while there is some risk of a negative sentiment due to increased competition, the overall impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be limited. Thus, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling."

                "reasoning": "The news presents a mixed bag for Apple. On one hand, Epic Games' continued challenge to Apple's App Store policies, including the Core Technology Fee, could eventually lead to changes that reduce Apple's revenue from the App Store. The fact that no top 100 grossing mobile game developers are willing to offer titles on the Epic Games Store due to Apple's fees is a negative signal. However, Apple has largely prevailed in court so far, and the news highlights the difficulty Epic is having in gaining traction. The impact of Epic's efforts is likely to be gradual and limited in the short term. The news also mentions Apple being asked to open up its App Store to outside payment options, which could impact revenue. Overall, the news leans slightly negative for Apple, but the impact is unlikely to be dramatic in the short term. The market's reaction will also depend on broader market trends and investor sentiment."

                "reasoning": "The news focuses on Epic Games' continued efforts to challenge Apple's App Store dominance. While Epic's actions could potentially pressure Apple in the long term, the immediate impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal. The article highlights Epic's struggles to attract top-tier developers to its own store, suggesting that the threat to Apple's App Store revenue is not yet significant.  The court case mentioned resulted in a ruling mostly favorable to Apple.  While Apple was required to open up its App Store to outside payment options, this is unlikely to significantly impact their overall profitability in the short term.  The news primarily focuses on Epic's challenges and investments, not on any significant negative impact on Apple's business. Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is higher than a fall, although the impact is expected to be small."

                "reasoning": "The news highlights Epic Games' continued challenge to Apple's App Store policies, which could potentially impact Apple's revenue from app store fees. However, the immediate financial impact on Apple is likely minimal given its diversified revenue streams and the current scale of Epic's alternative store. The legal and competitive pressures are not new, and Apple has previously adapted to similar challenges. The market may view this as a continuation of existing risks rather than a new threat. Therefore, the stock price movement is likely to be neutral or slightly negative in the short term."

Epic Games' move to add third-party game titles to its store and challenge Apple's and Google's dominance in the app store market could lead to increased scrutiny and potential regulatory pressure on Apple. Additionally, the criticism from Epic's CEO, Tim Sweeney, about Apple's Core Technology Fee and its impact on developers may negatively affect investor sentiment. However, Apple's stock price might not be significantly affected in the short term as the company has a strong market position and its financials are not heavily dependent on Epic Games. The probability of a stock price rise or fall depends on various factors including investor reaction, market trends, and Apple's overall performance."

However, the ongoing conflict and potential loss of revenue from app store fees could negatively affect Apple's stock price. On the other hand, Apple's strong brand and diverse revenue streams might mitigate the impact of this news.

This could lead to increased compliance costs, potential changes in business models, and reduced control over their ecosystems in a significant market. While the long-term impact is uncertain without knowing the specifics of India's demands, the immediate reaction is likely to be negative as investors dislike regulatory uncertainty and potential limitations on profitability. The fact that the full article is behind a paywall makes it difficult to assess the severity of the situation, but the headline itself suggests a potential negative impact."

This could be interpreted in a few ways.  A more open app store might increase competition, potentially impacting Apple's revenue from app sales and commissions.  However, it could also lead to increased app downloads and user engagement in the Indian market, a significant and growing market.  Without the full article, it's impossible to assess the severity of the potential impact.  The pressure from India might be minor, or it could represent a significant regulatory hurdle.  Given the uncertainty and the potential for both positive and negative impacts, I'm assigning a relatively neutral probability to both price movements.

This regulatory pressure could potentially impact Apple's revenue from its App Store, which is a significant part of its services segment. Given that India is a growing market for smartphones and digital services, increased regulatory scrutiny might lead to lower margins or reduced control over the App Store ecosystem. This could be perceived negatively by investors, leading to a potential decline in the stock price. However, the exact impact depends on how Apple responds to the pressure and whether it can negotiate favorable terms. Given the uncertainty and potential negative implications, the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than it rising."

        "content": "Big Tech\u2019s earnings season kicks off next week with a flurry of announcements from some of the industry\u2019s most important players including Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT). With the new year well under way, and AI still the hottest ticket in Silicon Valley, you can expect plenty of conversations about how companies are monetizing the technology and how much they spend on capital expenditures related to constructing data centers and producing new AI models.\n\nAnd looming over all of that will be how newly-inaugurated President Trump will impact tech\u2019s biggest trend in years. Whether it\u2019s tougher tariffs, export controls, or more relaxed antitrust regulations, Big Tech will be keeping a close eye on Washington. And investors are certain to want to know what that means for companies\u2019 bottom lines.\n\nTrump already made his mark on the AI scene on Tuesday, announcing Stargate, a $500 billion AI data center company headed by Softbank, OpenAI, and Oracle (ORCL) that will see the trio construct data centers to power AI projects within the U.S.\n\nIt\u2019s all going to make for quite an interesting earnings season, and it kicks off with Meta and Microsoft on Wednesday.\n\nThe Trump factor\n\nInvestors and analysts will want to know how companies are working with the administration to ensure they don\u2019t end up on the wrong end of Trump\u2019s proposed tariffs on goods from China.\n\nApple (AAPL), whose CEO Tim Cook has a good relationship with the president, avoided tariffs during the first Trump administration and will look to do so this time around, as well. Amazon (AMZN), Apple, Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta, and Microsoft could also see less regulation around antitrust matters and a return to mergers and acquisitions.(L-R) Priscilla Chan, Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg, Lauren Sanchez, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Tesla CEO Elon Musk attend the inauguration of Donald Trump on January 20, 2025. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\u00b7Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images\n\nThere\u2019s also the fate of the CHIPS Act. The legislation, passed under the Biden administration is meant to bring semiconductor manufacturing back to the US. But Trump has criticized the law, which provides billions in funding to chip makers, saying it was \u201cso bad\u201d during an appearance on Joe Rogan\u2019s podcast ahead of the election.\n\nWithout the cash, Intel (INTC), TSMC, Samsung, and a slew of other semiconductor companies may not be able to complete their ambitious plans to build new chip making facilities. Look for word on how the likes of Intel and its competitors are navigating the new administration and whether it\u2019s heard how it plans to address the CHIPS Act.\n\nAI revenue and spending\n\nIn addition to Trump, you can guarantee that virtually every tech company will mention AI revenue and spending. According to Jefferies analyst Brent Thill, Microsoft should report improved AI consumption and continued spending, something investors have been hoping for as the company works to meet customer demand for AI infrastructure.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDuring its prior quarter, Microsoft reported better than anticipated overall revenue and cloud and AI sales. But that wasn\u2019t enough to satisfy investors, sending the company\u2019s stock sinking 5% the day after the report.\n\nMeta\u2019s stock suffered a similar setback following its earnings last quarter, with shares falling after the company announced full-year 2024 cap-ex spending would increase from $37-$40 billion to $38-$40 billion.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(AMZN)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nGoogle and Amazon, on the other hand, won over investors with Google beating expectations on cloud revenue and Amazon improving overall margins.\n\nMicrosoft shares are up just 12% over the last 12 months, lagging the broader S&P 500, which rose 25% during the period. Amazon and Google shares are up 50% and 34%, respectively, while shares of Meta have climbed 64%.\n\nTikTok\u2019s clock gets a reset\n\nOne of the biggest issues for Meta and Google is what Trump will do with TikTok. Both companies stand to gain users and advertising dollars if the short-form video app is banned in the US. But Trump is working with TikTok CEO Shou Chew to find a way to keep the app up and running, despite a law calling for it to go offline.\n\nIf Trump and TikTok can\u2019t find a solution, the app might bite the dust, leaving its 170 million users, and the advertisers that want to reach them, with no place to turn than competing apps like Instagram and YouTube, which would be a boon for both companies.\n\nBut with Trump proclaiming that he\u2019d \u201csave\u201d TikTok on the campaign trail, it will be hard for him to back away from keeping the app afloat. We'll see what TikTok's rivals have to say, if anything, beginning next week.Sign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter.\u00b7yahoofinance\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

                "fall_prediction": 0.45,
                "reasoning": "The upcoming earnings season for Big Tech, including Apple, is likely to be influenced by both AI revenue discussions and the potential impact of Trump's administration on regulations and tariffs. Apple's strong relationship with Trump may mitigate concerns over tariffs, which could positively influence investor sentiment. However, the overall market reaction to earnings reports can be unpredictable, as seen with Microsoft and Meta's recent performance. Given the mixed signals from the news, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a stock price rise due to the favorable relationship with the administration and the focus on AI, but also acknowledge the risk of a fall based on broader market trends and earnings expectations."

                "reasoning": "The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). On one hand, Tim Cook's good relationship with President Trump could help Apple avoid tariffs, which would be positive. The potential for relaxed antitrust regulations could also benefit Apple through mergers and acquisitions. However, uncertainty surrounding the CHIPS Act and its potential impact on the semiconductor industry, as well as the broader economic impact of Trump's policies, introduces risk. The article also highlights the importance of AI revenue and spending, which will be a key focus for investors. The potential impact of Trump's stance on TikTok on competitors like Meta and Google is also mentioned, but this is less directly relevant to Apple. Considering these factors, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall, but significant uncertainty remains."

                "reasoning": "The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  While Trump's potential policies could be positive (less regulation, avoiding tariffs), there are also uncertainties.  The CHIPS Act's fate is unclear, impacting the semiconductor industry and potentially Apple's supply chain.  The AI revenue and spending will be a key focus, and while Apple is expected to discuss its AI initiatives, the market reaction will depend on the specifics.  The overall impact of Trump's policies on the tech sector is uncertain, creating volatility.  Given Apple's strong brand and generally positive relationship with Trump, the probability of a price rise is slightly higher than a fall, but the uncertainty warrants a relatively low probability for both outcomes."

                "reasoning": "The news highlights several factors that could influence Apple's stock price. Positive aspects include Apple's CEO Tim Cook's good relationship with President Trump, which may help avoid tariffs and lead to less antitrust regulation, potentially benefiting Apple's bottom line. Additionally, the focus on AI and potential benefits from the CHIPS Act could be favorable. However, uncertainties around Trump's policies, such as potential tariffs and changes to the CHIPS Act, introduce risks. The overall sentiment is mixed but leans slightly positive due to Apple's strong position and relationships."

Additionally, the article highlights the importance of AI revenue and spending, which Apple is likely to address during its earnings call.

The article mentions that Trump's administration may impose tougher tariffs, export controls, or more relaxed antitrust regulations, which could affect the companies' revenue and spending. However, it also notes that Apple's CEO Tim Cook has a good relationship with Trump, which may help the company avoid tariffs. Additionally, the article mentions that Trump's plans for the CHIPS Act and his stance on TikTok could also impact the tech industry.

Regulatory scrutiny often creates uncertainty and can lead to potential fines or changes in business practices, which investors generally perceive negatively. While the full impact is unknown without the details of the probe, the initial reaction is likely to be slightly negative. The fact that the full article is behind a paywall limits the depth of analysis possible. However, given Apple's size and the fact that this is just a probe (not a definitive ruling), the impact is likely to be moderate. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a stock price fall than a rise."

While the specifics of the investigation are unknown due to the paywalled nature of the article, regulatory investigations generally introduce uncertainty and potential negative consequences.  Fines or mandated changes could negatively impact Apple's profitability. However, Apple is a large, established company with significant resources to navigate such investigations.  The impact is likely to be relatively small compared to other factors influencing Apple's stock price, such as overall market conditions, product releases, and financial performance. Therefore, a significant price drop is less likely than a minor fluctuation.  The probability of a price rise is also low, as the news is predominantly negative in nature."

Historically, such regulatory investigations can create uncertainty and negative sentiment among investors, often leading to short-term stock price declines. However, Apple's strong market position and financial resilience might mitigate some of the negative impact. The probability of a stock price fall is higher due to the immediate negative sentiment, but the probability of a rise is lower unless Apple provides a strong counter-response or the probe is resolved favorably."

However, they express concern about overall market valuation and believe AI stocks offer better and faster returns. The mention of 'disappointing' data and 'expensive' stock by Dan Niles further dampens the outlook. The decrease in hedge fund holdings from 184 to 158 suggests a weakening sentiment. While Apple's Q3 revenue was up 6%, the overall tone leans towards caution and a preference for other investment opportunities, specifically AI stocks.

Their lower-than-average market exposure and the mention of Apple being 'pretty expensive' by Dan Niles (though not directly quoted from Greenlight) suggest a bearish sentiment towards Apple in the short term.  The decrease in hedge fund holdings of Apple also points to a potential lack of strong bullish conviction. While Apple's revenue growth is positive, the overall tone of the news leans negative.  Therefore, the probability of a price fall is considered higher than a price rise, although the probabilities are not extreme due to Apple's overall market position and potential for long-term growth."

On the other hand, Apple's 52-week gain of 15.28% and its position as the 8th most popular stock among hedge funds suggest underlying strength. The mention of AI stocks as more promising might divert some investor interest away from Apple.

Last week, Jefferies analysts downgraded Apple\u2019s rating, citing expectations of a miss for both fiscal first quarter results and guidance.\n\nShares of Apple were up 0.25% Wednesday morning, after closing at $223.83 Tuesday.\n\nApple\u2019s iPhone 17 and 18 sales are expected to \u201cbe weak,\u201d Jefferies said, \u201cbecause there are limited hardware upgrades to drive adoption.\u201d Following Asia supply chain checks, Jefferies also said it is \u201ccautious\u201d over demand for Apple\u2019s rumored iPhone SE 4, which it said is likely to launch toward the end of March.\n\nThis slide in stock price caused chipmaker Nvidia to overtake Apple as the most valuable company in the world on Tuesday.\n\nBut analysts at Wedbush said that overall unit declines in China are \u201cmanageable,\u201d and that investors will get a better understanding of Apple\u2019s China turnaround once it announces its regional AI partner, which will likely be Baidu (BIDU). Tencent (TCEHY) and ByteDance are also in the running, Ives said.\n\nAs a result, the securities firm maintained its \u201cOutperform\u201d rating and $325 price target\n\n\u201cWith Apple Intelligence being rolled out in a phased strategy the iPhone 16 upgrade cycle is the start of a massive growth renaissance at Apple and that bull thesis remains intact as we see ~20% of the world\u2019s population ultimately accessing AI through an Apple device over the coming years,\u201d Ives wrote.\n\nAlthough Jefferies and others have raised concerns about Apple\u2019s AI strategy, which came late in the game compared with competitors and is being rolled out in phases through the tech giant\u2019s latest models, Ives believes 2025 will be a \u201cfork in the road year\u201d for Apple.\n\n\u201cRome wasn\u2019t built in a day and neither will Apple\u2019s AI strategy,\u201d Ives said. \u201cbut the seeds of that strategy with Apple Intelligence are now forming and will transform the Apple consumer growth narrative over the coming years.\u201d\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView Comments",

On the other hand, Wedbush maintains an \"Outperform\" rating with a significantly higher price target, citing manageable China declines, the potential of their AI strategy (Apple Intelligence), and a large potential user base for AI through Apple devices. The phrase \"fork in the road year\" suggests a pivotal moment with uncertain outcomes. The current small rise of 0.25% suggests a slight positive reaction to the Wedbush note, but the overall negative sentiment from Jefferies and the YTD decline temper this. Considering the conflicting analyst opinions and the inherent uncertainty of a \"fork in the road year\", I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price fall, but not overwhelmingly so."

The current stock price is below the Wedbush target, suggesting potential upside. However, the negative sentiment from Jefferies and the recent stock price decline (over 8% YTD) introduce downside risk.

Jefferies downgraded Apple's rating based on these concerns. However, Wedbush analysts remain optimistic, citing that the panic is overdone and maintaining an 'Outperform' rating with a $325 price target. They highlight Apple's AI strategy (Apple Intelligence) and the upcoming iPhone 16 upgrade cycle as potential growth drivers, especially with a regional AI partner in China (likely Baidu).

        "headline": "Jim Cramer Thinks Apple Inc. (AAPL) Will Miss Earnings, Despite AI Innovation \u2013 Here\u2019s Why",
        "content": "We recently published a list of Jim Cramer Discusses TikTok Ban, President Trump & These 6 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discusses.\n\nIn one of his latest appearances on CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer maintained his view that President Trump and his administration will be quite pro-business. Commenting on Trump\u2019s statements at his inauguration, Cramer started out by saying, \u201cI think that, regardless, it\u2019s a very pro-business regime.\u201d He explained that his view came despite \u201ca story that the FT just ran about Donald Trump threatening tax wherever US multinationals [are].\u201d According to Cramer, the story \u201cis the only thing I have heard so far that just tells me, you could one day raise numbers. I think it\u2019s important, David because we live in a raise numbers, decline numbers world.\u201d\n\nAs to Trump\u2019s policies, one shift that caught his attention was the President\u2019s aim to invigorate the American oil production industry. \u201cWell look I think that the only substantive stuff from the market is that prices for oil are going to go down \u2019cause he\u2019s going to get us to pump more,\u201d Cramer outlined. \u201cAnd I think that the discipline of the oil companies versus what he said, could be, that\u2019s front and center,\u201d he added. However, Cramer cautioned that \u201c[t]he oil companies are not into drilling all over the place. They realize that their stocks had kind of a housing moment because they held back. And now they\u2019re being told, drill. I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll respond to that. I just don\u2019t think that they will.\u201d\n\nContinuing his remarks on the US energy industry, he shifted his focus to the gas sector. Cramer believes that America needs \u201cmore pipe[line], we\u2019re out of pipe[line] to send the natural gas from the Permian.\u201d He outlined that President Trump \u201cbasically undid that January pause about building new facilities for natural gas.\u201d Cramer believes that the move was necessary \u201c[b]ecause a lot of projects, longer-term projects got halted. They will come back. But we don\u2019t have a lot of what\u2019s known as trains. We don\u2019t have enough car loads to be able to ship as much natural gas . . . it just looks like, that you can\u2019t ship more, as long as you don\u2019t have a lot of, facilities. And we don\u2019t have enough facilities to ship. And that does matter.\u201d\n\nHowever, one thing from Trump\u2019s inauguration speech that surprised Cramer was his take on China. \u201cSo far China kind of got off the hook,\u201d he believes. This apparently relaxed attitude towards China also might have led to markets performing well, with Cramer stating, \u201c[a]nd I think that\u2019s another reason that people are pretty buoyant.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nAnother aspect of the new administration that has caught investor and public attention is the Department of Government Efficiency or DOGE. Headed by Elon Musk, the department aims to reduce purported wasteful spending in the US government. Cramer believes DOGE has its work cut out. According to him, \u201c[r]ight now DOGE sounds like, we\u2019re going to put some guys in. They\u2019re going to make a difference. It doesn\u2019t work like that. I mean, well the deep swamp, well, it\u2019s the deep state. But you know what I\u2019m saying is that the swamp is hard to clear with just four guys.\u201d\n\nHowever, the CNBC host does believe that the tech sector could modernize the government\u2019s operations. \u201cIt could be. I mean take a look at all the hacking. When you speak to cybersecurity people, they say, look the technology is many years old. They didn\u2019t keep up,\u201d he shared.\n\nHe also commented on President Biden and how he stood out when it came to wealth. \u201cWhen the previous president got it . . . .there was no billionaires for Biden. He was not into that,\u201d Cramer shared. According to him, \u201c[h]e [Biden] wasn\u2019t into hundred millionaires. . . . he didn\u2019t like em. He didn\u2019t like them, he felt that they represented the wrong stream of thought in America. That\u2019s just what he did. He was also very proud of how poor he was. Which is a very, which is anomalous. We do not have a lot of people who are proud of being poor!\u201d\n\nShifting gears, Cramer then commented on the ongoing saga of TikTok\u2019s ban in the US. While the application is still banned, it has been granted a temporary reprieve by the President as he attempts to reach a solution that balances national security with a popular software application. Cramer shared that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision upholding the Protecting Americans Against Foreign Adversaries Act (PAFCA) was quite unique. According to him, \u201c[t]hey handed down, the only time I\u2019ve ever seen it, one hundred percent. One hundred percent agreement. Everybody.\u201d He added according to the court\u2019s opinion, it was clear that \u201cthere is a huge national security risk.\u201d\n\nWhen co-host David Faber countered and claimed that the court had simply agreed with Congress, Cramer replied, \u201cRight, but I\u2019m saying Bill [Bill Ford of General Atlantic] would be contrary to the, one of the few times that the court was unanimous about national security risk.\u201d Cramer backed his argument by outlining the kinds of user data that TikTok collects. He explained, \u201c[b]y the way, if you look at what they get from you when you sign up.\u00a0 Now, I\u2019m not close to Joe Rogan. I listened to Mark Zuckerberg talk about hunting with Joe, but Joe did read, he did read down what you give them when you sign up. And you give them, everything. Everything. They have access to everything.\u201d\n\nHe also commented on whether there\u2019s a backdoor for access despite the data being hosted in the US. \u201cThere is! The Supreme Court says it\u2019s not even a backdoor. Supreme Court basically says it\u2019s a front door,\u201d Cramer believes. He added, \u201cI think they went a step further. I think that Chief Justice Roberts basically just said this is a Manchurian candidate. He didn\u2019t use that term, but he meant it.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired on January 21st.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in?

(see more details here).Jim Cramer Thinks Apple Inc. (AAPL) Will Miss Earnings, Despite AI Innovation - Here's Why\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nConsumer electronics and technology giant Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is another stock that\u2019s regularly on Cramer\u2019s radar. Most of his remarks this year have revolved around social media CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s remarks that innovation had ended at Apple since Steve Jobs\u2019 death and around the upcoming earnings. Cramer disagrees with Zuckerberg\u2019s assessment, and his latest comments about Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) tied his beliefs about the upcoming earnings with recent analyst coverage:\n\n\u201cApple\u2019s gonna miss big. I mean I can\u2019t believe that anyone is still around who thinks that they haven\u2019t guided down enough. I mean the new one obviously is that the quarter\u2019s going to be bad but wait till you see the guidance. It\u2019s really. . . .I mean AI\u2019s not working and everyone is missing the fact China orders have plummeted, everyone, I mean you could go on the subway, like David does, and ask the average person how\u2019s Apple gonna do. And they\u2019re gonna say it. They\u2019re gonna miss. You know if everybody thinks something is a surprise, it\u2019s not a surprise! Okay. They\u2019re acting like it\u2019s, they\u2019re acting like it\u2019s the Commanders.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of stocks that Jim Cramer discusses. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

                "reasoning": "The news article focuses on Jim Cramer's prediction that Apple will miss earnings expectations, citing weakening China orders and the underperformance of AI initiatives.  While Cramer acknowledges Apple's AI innovation, his strong negative sentiment regarding the upcoming earnings and guidance significantly outweighs any positive aspects.  The article also highlights the widespread negative sentiment surrounding Apple's performance, suggesting a consensus view of an earnings miss.  This negative outlook from a prominent financial commentator, coupled with the general expectation of poor performance, increases the likelihood of a stock price decline.  However, it's important to note that Cramer's predictions are not always accurate, and other factors could influence the stock price.  Therefore, while the probability of a price fall is higher, a price rise is still possible due to unforeseen positive developments or market-wide trends."

Additionally, the mention of declining orders in China and skepticism around AI's impact suggests potential headwinds for Apple's stock. However, Apple's strong brand, loyal customer base, and historical resilience might mitigate some downside. The mixed sentiment and lack of concrete data in the article make the outcome uncertain but lean slightly negative."

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Oracle Corp. has charged out of the gate in 2025, after its best year in a quarter-century. A plan unveiled with President Donald Trump has intensified hopes that its cloud business will see a tailwind from artificial intelligence.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHow Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump Texas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters Donations to LA Fire Victims Rise Past $200 Million Mark LA Schools Wrecked by Fires Plead on GoFundMe for Help to Reopen NY\u2019s Hochul Calls for Law Banning Cell Phone Use in Schools\n\nThe stock\u2019s latest advance came on news the software company is forming a $100 billion joint venture with SoftBank Group Corp. and OpenAI to fund an expansion of data centers to support a business in which Oracle lags behind rivals like Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp.\n\n\u201cThis certainly has us looking at the name in a way we hadn\u2019t before, since this could represent a meaningful inflection in growth,\u201d said Tim Ghriskey, senior portfolio strategist at Ingalls & Snyder. \u201cIt seems like it is in good company here, but my main hesitation is about how long this halo might last, since the stock has really rocketed.\u201d\n\nOracle shares have performed like some of the tech giants that have driven the market\u2019s gains for the past two years, as it seeks to establish itself as a major player in cloud computing. The stock is up more than 10% in January after posting a nearly 60% gain last year, its best performance since 1999.\n\nThe joint venture has a goal of growing to \u201cat least\u201d $500 billion, which would be considerable in comparison to the tens of billions of dollars that megacaps have poured into AI. UBS expects the combined capex of major tech companies will come in at $280 billion in 2025.\n\nHowever, there are questions about the scope of new commitments and whether the news represents a dramatic increase from previously announced plans. Elon Musk publicly questioned whether the companies could follow through on their promises, while Anthropic\u2019s CEO also queried the financing and said the project seemed \u201ca bit chaotic.\u201d\n\nIn a sign of the headline whiplash that has accompanied his return to the presidency, Trump also said he would be open to Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison buying TikTok as part of a joint venture with the US government, a prospect that is difficult to measure in terms of its likelihood or impact.\n\n\u201cThis is all very speculative, and potentially meaningful, but it sounds crazy to me in a lot of ways,\u201d Ghriskey said. \u201cIt is good to be on Trump\u2019s good side, but that can be a short-term thing.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nA Small, Growing Player\n\nCompared to the big three of Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet Inc., Oracle is a small player in cloud computing. It has a less than 5% share in the infrastructure-as-a-service market, compared with Amazon Web Services at more than 40% and Microsoft around 16%, according to Bloomberg Intelligence \u2014 which also estimated the venture could help grow its cloud infrastructure sales from a roughly $10 billion annual run rate currently to $30 billion or $40 billion over the coming years.\n\n\u201cThis moves Oracle even closer to the ballpark that Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet are mentioned in,\u201d said Jim Awad, senior managing director at Clearstead Advisors, referring to the venture. \u201cWhile there\u2019s probably some hype around Trump\u2019s announcement, this is still a clear positive. It is in such a powerful long-term uptrend that you need to stay involved, even if valuations aren\u2019t exactly cheap anymore.\u201d\n\nWhile Oracle\u2019s most recent results failed to live up to high expectations, Wall Street has steadily grown more positive on its prospects, and growth in Oracle\u2019s cloud infrastructure business is expected to far outpace its overall revenue growth this year, according to Bloomberg Consensus estimates.\n\nStill, the stock\u2019s rally on the venture news hasn\u2019t been met with a commensurate increase in the analyst consensus. Expectations for the company\u2019s net 2025 and 2026 earnings are up just 0.2% over the past week, while the view for revenue is unchanged.\n\nThe stock\u2019s forward earnings multiple has swelled above 27, well above its 10-year average of 15.8. It also trades at a premium to the Nasdaq 100 Index, though it is below Microsoft\u2019s multiple of 31.\n\nJoe Tigay, portfolio manager of the Rational Equity Armor Fund, is among those taking a cautious eye toward the stock\u2019s rally.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s prudent to wait and see what the actual earnings are and what the actual company says about all these projects, rather than just pricing it in right now because the timing is often uncertain and how big of an impact is always uncertain.\u201d\n\nHe added that it was impossible to assess the the prospect of a deal surrounding TikTok without further details.\n\n\u201cIn terms of value for Oracle, it\u2019s really hard for me to say that would be great for the bottom line or terrible.\u201d\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nApple Inc. has slumped almost 11% in January putting the stock on track for its biggest one-month decline since December 2022. Earlier this week, at least two analysts from Loop Capital and Jefferies downgraded their ratings on the stock as weak iPhone sales are becoming an increasing concern for investors. The stock is down about 14% from a December peak.\n\nTop Tech Stories\n\nSK Hynix Inc.\u2019s shares slid after record quarterly results failed to impress investors grappling with stagnant smartphone demand and questions about AI spending in 2025. Elon Musk openly questioned whether companies that joined President Donald Trump\u2019s announcement promising hundreds of billions of dollars in artificial intelligence infrastructure could follow through on their promises, exposing an early internal rift within the White House. President Trump downplayed the national security risk posed by TikTok in an interview with Fox News on Wednesday, days after offering the social video app a reprieve from legislation that would have forced it to shut down. India is trying to pry open the doors of the world\u2019s biggest app stores, setting up a likely clash with Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc. over social services, safety standards and access to the country\u2019s smartphones. An Indian appeals court temporarily halted an antitrust ruling that fined WhatsApp and prohibited the messenger from sharing user data with other firms and products owned by parent Meta Platforms Inc. Samsung Electronics Co. plans to launch an ultrathin version of its Galaxy S25 phone in the first half of this year, beating Apple Inc. to a promising new category.\n\nEarnings Due Thursday\n\nPremarket\n\nOSI Systems Postmarket\n\nTexas Instruments\n\n--With assistance from Carmen Reinicke and Subrat Patnaik.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Kendrick Lamar Turned Beef With Drake Into Music Superstardom Elon Musk\u2019s Inaugural Highs (and Lows) Greek Police Say Eggs Were Stolen from IVF Clinic Patients Walgreens Replaced Fridge Doors With Smart Screens.

        "content": "Had you invested $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) when Warren Buffett became its CEO in 1965, you would have $42.5 million today. The same investment in the S&P 500 would have grown to just $343,000 over the same period, which highlights Buffett's incredible ability to pick stocks.\n\nYou won't ever find Buffett chasing the latest stock market trends, not even one as powerful as artificial intelligence (AI). However, four existing holdings in Berkshire's $297 billion portfolio of publicly traded securities are using AI to supercharge their legacy businesses.Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\n1. Domino's Pizza: 0.2% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio\n\nBerkshire bought shares in Domino's Pizza(NASDAQ: DPZ) during the third quarter of 2024 (ended Sept. 30), so it's a relatively new addition to the portfolio. It's the world's largest pizza chain, serving over 1 million customers per day from its 21,000 stores across 90 countries.\n\nDomino's uses technology extensively to improve efficiency, which translates into lower costs and higher profits. The company has deployed an AI algorithm to identify patterns in customer behavior, so it knows when to start making pizzas -- even before an order is officially completed on its website. That means customers receive their food faster than ever.\n\nEventually, Domino's wants AI to handle everything from inventory management to staff scheduling, so this is just the beginning of a technological revolution at the company.\n\nWinning the approval of Buffett and his team wasn't easy last year, because Berkshire was a net seller of stocks overall. Domino's was one of just five new additions to the conglomerate's portfolio, which might be a very bullish sign for the pizza giant.\n\n2. Amazon: 0.8% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) is the world's largest e-commerce company. It also dominates the cloud computing industry, and it has a growing presence in digital advertising and streaming. AI isn't just a tool for Amazon, it's going to be a core part of its entire organization.\n\nThe company already uses AI in its recommendation engine to show customers products they are likely to buy. And it developed an AI assistant called Rufus to help customers with their purchase decisions.\n\nEven Amazon's fulfillment centers rely on AI -- aside from the fleets of autonomous robots, a new technology called Project Private Investigator uses AI and computer vision to identify defective products before they are shipped to customers.\n\nThen there is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud platform, which is becoming a preferred destination for developers looking to build AI software. AWS is working to dominate the three core layers of AI cloud services: infrastructure (data centers and chips), large language models (LLMs), and software.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, management said AI revenue within AWS grew by a triple-digit percentage year over year, and it's currently growing three times faster than the cloud business did at the same stage of its life cycle.\n\nBerkshire bought Amazon stock in 2019, but Buffett has often expressed regret for not identifying the company's potential much sooner. Nevertheless, his company's position is worth over $2.3 billion, so Berkshire stands to make a substantial amount of money if Amazon remains a leader in the AI race.\n\n3. Coca-Cola: 8.4% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio\n\nCoca-Cola(NYSE: KO) is the world's largest beverage company, with people in 200 countries consuming 1.9 billion servings of its drinks every day. Achieving that level of scale wouldn't be possible without technology, and Coca-Cola is staying true to its history as an innovator by investing heavily in AI.\n\nIn April 2024, the company made a commitment to spend $1.1 billion over five years on Microsoft's Azure cloud platform, where it will access a portfolio of AI services to improve its supply chains, productivity, and marketing.\n\nSpeaking of marketing, Coca-Cola has already used AI in several campaigns. It launched Create Real Magic during the recent holiday period, which allowed users to generate holiday-themed digital snow globes on the company's website.\n\nPrior to that, it used AI to create a promotional version of its flagship soda called Coca-Cola Y3000, which captured what the drink could taste like in the year 3000 based on mountains of data from customers.\n\nBerkshire acquired 400 million shares of Coke between 1988 and 1994, at a total cost of $1.3 billion. It never sold a single share, and today, that stake is worth over $25 billion. Buffett probably never anticipated AI would become such a big part of Coca-Cola's future, but Berkshire will benefit from the value it creates, nonetheless.\n\n4. Apple: 22.7% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) accounted for around 50% of the total value of Berkshire's portfolio at the beginning of 2024, but Buffett and his team decided to take some of the conglomerate's profits by selling over half of the position. Apple remains Berkshire's largest holding, though, with a 22.7% weighting in its portfolio.\n\nManagement has been preparing for the AI revolution for a while. Its strategy began with hardware, because the company had to design new chips and components for its latest iPhones, iPads, and Mac computers that were powerful enough to support the technology. With those now in place, the company was able to launch its Apple Intelligence software last year, which introduced swathes of new AI features.\n\nThese include new writing tools that empower users to quickly summarize email and text messages and then generate outgoing replies. Apple Intelligence can also prioritize notifications for users based on their preferences, saving them time. Even the Siri voice assistant received a makeover, because it now taps into the knowledge and capabilities of OpenAI's ChatGPT.\n\nThere are more than 2.2 billion active Apple devices worldwide, so the company could eventually become the largest distributor of AI to consumers. Therefore, despite the selling spree last year, Berkshire could still do extremely well over the long term with its remaining stake.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Domino's Pizza right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Domino's Pizza, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Domino's Pizza wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "headline": "Could Nvidia Unseat Apple as the Largest Company in the World in 2025?",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) are the two largest companies in the world by market capitalization. While Nvidia is valued at roughly $3.38 trillion as of this writing and stands as the second-biggest business, Apple has a valuation of $3.46 trillion and is at the top of the heap.\n\nNotably, both of these tech giants are leaders in different corners of the hardware market. Nvidia is the leading designer of advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) for artificial intelligence (AI) and data center computing. Meanwhile, Apple leads the smartphone market with its iPhone lines and captures the majority of global operating profits from mobile phone sales.\n\nAs hardware-focused businesses, Apple and Nvidia's position atop the list of the world's most valuable companies looks even more noteworthy because software-focused businesses usually tend to be more profitable. But while Apple should be able to continue commanding very strong margins on its mobile hardware and other offerings in 2025, the stage could be set for Nvidia to deliver superior stock performance and take the title of \"world's most valuable company\" this year.\n\nNvidia's outlook for 2025 appears stronger than Apple's\n\nNvidia stock has been on an incredible run as rising demand for AI technologies has spurred massive sales and earnings growth for the company. The AI leader's share price rocketed 131.5% higher over the last year, and there were brief periods in 2024 when it had a higher market cap than Apple and stood as the world's largest company. While Nvidia's business has historically been shaped by cyclical demand trends in the semiconductor industry and will face tougher growth comparisons in 2025, its outlook still appears stronger than Apple's.\n\nApple is facing some performance headwinds in China -- its second-largest geographic segment by revenue. The mobile hardware giant hasn't been able to find a suitable Chinese partner to incorporate its Apple Intelligence platform into its latest iPhones. Due to regulations put in place by China's government, many products and services need to have a domestic operational partner in order to be sold in the country. As a result, the iPhone 16s in China do not have the Apple Intelligence platform and are facing a tougher competitive environment because of it.\n\nApple is also facing some regulatory pressures in the domestic market. In March of last year, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) filed an antitrust suit against the company alleging that it has created an illegal monopoly on the smartphone market by tying developers into its ecosystem through contractual restrictions. While it's possible that the DOJ under the new Trump administration will take a comparatively hands-off approach to antitrust matters and other issues compared to operations under the Biden administration, it's not clear the iPhone maker will benefit from this dynamic.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMargins and sales trends support Nvidia taking the crown\n\nOver the trailing-12-month period, Apple posted a gross profit of $180.7 billion on sales of $391 billion -- good for a gross margin of 46.2%. Meanwhile, Nvidia has posted a gross profit of $85.9 billion on sales of $113.3 billion across the same stretch -- representing a gross margin of 75.8%. So while Apple has generated far more overall sales and gross profit over the past year, Nvidia's gross profit margin is far higher. This distinction becomes even more significant when looking at recent sales momentum for both businesses.\n\nNvidia's revenue increased 94% year over year to reach $35.1 billion in its most recently reported quarter (ended Oct. 27, 2024). Earnings per share for the period surged 111% annually to reach $0.78.\n\nFor comparison, Apple's revenue increased 6% year over year to $94.9 billion -- and its diluted earnings per share rose 12% to hit $1.64. Market data from Counterpoint Research suggests that Apple's iPhone unit shipments fell 5% year over year in the final quarter of 2024, so sales growth will be harder to deliver with its next financial report.\n\nIn order to return to stronger sales and earnings growth, Apple may need to deliver a new product or a software service offering with a more groundbreaking impact. The company's iPhone lines reliably serve up strong sales and great margins, but the smartphone market is saturated -- and growth has become harder to deliver.\n\nIn contrast, the demand outlook for Nvidia's GPUs continues to be very strong in 2025 amid ongoing AI infrastructure spending, and the rollout of the company's new Blackwell processors should support strong sales expansion and margins. With that in mind, I think there's a very good chance that Nvidia will take the title of \"world's most valuable company\" back from Apple and hold on to it for most of this year.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

In contrast, Nvidia is experiencing strong growth driven by demand for AI technologies, which may enhance its market position. Given these factors, there is a higher likelihood of Apple's stock price falling compared to rising, as the competitive landscape appears to favor Nvidia. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of stock price decline for Apple."

                "reasoning": "The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While it acknowledges Apple's current market capitalization lead, it highlights several headwinds: slowing growth in China due to regulatory issues with Apple Intelligence, potential antitrust issues in the US, and slower revenue growth compared to Nvidia. The article emphasizes Nvidia's strong growth driven by AI demand and superior gross profit margins. While the article doesn't explicitly predict a stock price fall for Apple, the negative factors and the comparison to Nvidia's stronger outlook suggest a higher probability of a price decrease than an increase. The Motley Fool's disclaimer about Nvidia not being on their current top 10 list adds a slight counter-narrative, but the overall tone leans negative for Apple's short-term stock performance."

                "reasoning": "The article highlights Nvidia's strong growth driven by AI demand and superior margins compared to Apple.  Apple faces headwinds in China and regulatory pressures in the US, coupled with slowing iPhone sales growth. While Apple maintains a larger market cap currently, Nvidia's projected stronger growth trajectory suggests a higher probability of it surpassing Apple's valuation. However, the article's focus is on market capitalization, not necessarily stock price.  A rise in Nvidia's market cap doesn't automatically translate to a rise in its stock price, and vice-versa for Apple.  The probabilities below reflect the likelihood of the *stock price* moving based on the news, acknowledging the indirect relationship between market cap and stock price.  The news is more likely to positively impact Nvidia's stock price and negatively impact Apple's, but the magnitude of the impact is uncertain."

Apple, on the other hand, faces challenges such as performance headwinds in China, regulatory pressures, and saturation in the smartphone market. Given this comparative analysis, the news is likely to be perceived negatively for Apple, as it underscores potential competitive disadvantages and growth challenges relative to Nvidia."

Nvidia's strong outlook for 2025, driven by rising demand for AI technologies, is contrasted with Apple's performance headwinds in China and regulatory pressures. Nvidia's higher gross profit margin and recent sales momentum also support its potential to take the crown.

The 'shouldn't matter to investors' part of the headline is crucial. It implies that the market might not react negatively to the perceived lack of innovation, potentially because Apple's financial performance remains robust. However, the initial statement about innovation could create some uncertainty. Therefore, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a rise, assuming the market focuses on the latter part of the headline and Apple's overall financial strength."

The article likely provides counterarguments, such as Apple's strong brand loyalty, robust ecosystem, and continued financial success despite a perceived lack of groundbreaking innovation.  Zuckerberg's opinion, while noteworthy, is not a definitive indicator of Apple's future performance.  The market likely already prices in a degree of perceived stagnation in innovation, and the article suggests this is already factored into the stock price. Therefore, the news is unlikely to cause a significant price movement in either direction. A slight upward movement is possible if investors interpret the article's counterarguments as reassuring."

        "content": "The latest trading session saw Apple (AAPL) ending at $223.83, denoting a +0.53% adjustment from its last day's close. This move lagged the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.61%. Elsewhere, the Dow gained 0.3%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 1.28%.\n\nShares of the maker of iPhones, iPads and other products witnessed a loss of 13.77% over the previous month, trailing the performance of the Computer and Technology sector with its gain of 1.24% and the S&P 500's gain of 2.08%.\n\nThe investment community will be closely monitoring the performance of Apple in its forthcoming earnings report. The company is scheduled to release its earnings on January 30, 2025. The company's earnings per share (EPS) are projected to be $2.36, reflecting an 8.26% increase from the same quarter last year. At the same time, our most recent consensus estimate is projecting a revenue of $124.1 billion, reflecting a 3.78% rise from the equivalent quarter last year.\n\nAAPL's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $7.43 per share and revenue of $412.79 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +10.07% and +5.56%, respectively.\n\nInvestors should also pay attention to any latest changes in analyst estimates for Apple. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. Hence, positive alterations in estimates signify analyst optimism regarding the company's business and profitability.\n\nEmpirical research indicates that these revisions in estimates have a direct correlation with impending stock price performance. To exploit this, we've formed the Zacks Rank, a quantitative model that includes these estimate changes and presents a viable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, which varies between #1 (Strong Buy) and #5 (Strong Sell), carries an impressive track record of exceeding expectations, confirmed by external audits, with stocks at #1 delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection remained stagnant. Apple currently has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nInvestors should also note Apple's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 29.97. This signifies a premium in comparison to the average Forward P/E of 12.99 for its industry.\n\nIt is also worth noting that AAPL currently has a PEG ratio of 2.18. Comparable to the widely accepted P/E ratio, the PEG ratio also accounts for the company's projected earnings growth. The average PEG ratio for the Computer - Micro Computers industry stood at 1.61 at the close of the market yesterday.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe Computer - Micro Computers industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry, currently bearing a Zacks Industry Rank of 95, finds itself in the top 38% echelons of all 250+ industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our individual industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nMake sure to utilize Zacks.com to follow all of these stock-moving metrics, and more, in the coming trading sessions.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Upcoming earnings are projected to show growth in EPS and revenue, which is positive. However, the Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) suggests a neutral outlook. The high Forward P/E and PEG ratios indicate that the stock is trading at a premium compared to its industry, which could limit upside potential. The industry rank is relatively strong. Overall, the positive earnings projections are somewhat offset by valuation concerns and recent underperformance.

        "headline": "Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff's war of words with Microsoft rages on at Davos",
        "content": "DAVOS, SWITZERLAND \u2014 The weather may have been teeth-chattering along the promenade in Davos, but that didn't stop Salesforce (CRM) co-founder and CEO Marc Benioff from firing off a few new choice words on AI rival Microsoft (MSFT).\n\n\"Everybody knows that Microsoft has disappointed the world with Copilot and I mean, that's just a repackaged ChatGPT. You know that,\" Benioff told Yahoo Finance at the World Economic Forum, continuing his long-running criticism of Microsoft's AI business tools.\n\nThis comes hot on the heels of a shot at Salesforce by Microsoft's often reserved CEO Satya Nadella.\n\n\u201cI think the notion that business applications exist, that\u2019s probably where they\u2019ll all collapse, right, in the agent era, because if you think about it right, they are essentially CRUD databases with a bunch of business logic,\u201d Nadella said on a recent podcast taping with venture capitalists Bill Gurley and Brad Gerstner.\n\nMicrosoft spokesperson Frank Shaw declined to comment to Yahoo Finance on Benioff's remark.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(CRM)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nBenioff's AI bots, which can autonomously answer customer questions or describe products to clients, are going toe to toe with Microsoft's Copilot for workplace supremacy.\n\nSalesforce closed 200 Agentforce deals in the third quarter. New users included FedEx (FDX), IBM (IBM), and Accenture (ACN). In total, Salesforce said it closed 2,000 AI-related deals in the third quarter.\n\nBenioff declined to provide an updated figure on the number of Agentforce deals closed since the end of the third quarter. A source familiar with Salesforce told Yahoo Finance consumption of Agentforce has been strong out of the gate, an important bottom line signal as the company gets paid $2 per conversation.\n\n\"Well, this is going way faster than anything we've ever done, and it has been amazing, and it's very exciting,\" Benioff said.\n\nThe Street has largely piled onto the bull narrative on AI agents, sending Salesforce's stock up more than 25% since new Agentforce solutions were introduced at the company's annual Dreamforce event on Sept. 17.\n\nBut there are a few skeptics.\n\nEarlier this month, Guggenheim analyst John DiFucci downgraded his rating to Sell in a rare move. He's only the second analyst on the Street to rate Salesforce a Sell out of 51, according to Yahoo Finance data.\n\n\"We do not believe that Salesforce will meaningfully monetize Agentforce unless it acquires several assets that have been doing, over the past decade, what Agentforce aspires to do. Salesforce's status as a system of record gives it staying power, but in our view doesn\u2019t give it any advantage in providing AI solutions that require dynamic data with rich context versus the static data that Salesforce houses,\" DiFucci said.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u2014\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Samsung Electronics Co. plans to launch an ultrathin version of its Galaxy S25 phone in the first half of this year, beating Apple Inc. to a promising new category.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTexas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump Donations to LA Fire Victims Rise Past $200 Million Mark NY\u2019s Hochul Calls for Law Banning Cell Phone Use in Schools LA Schools Wrecked by Fires Plead on GoFundMe for Help to Reopen\n\nThe company previewed a phone called the Galaxy S25 Edge at the conclusion of its Samsung Unpacked presentation Wednesday in San Jose, California. Building on an S25 lineup that was unveiled earlier at the event, the Edge model is notable for its extremely thin profile.\n\nThe move sets up a showdown this year in the skinny smartphone segment. Apple also is expected to add an ultrathin version to its iPhone line later this year, marking one of its boldest design changes in years. That company typically unveils its new phones in September.\n\nSamsung plans to start selling the Edge in the US and other markets by the middle of the year, TM Roh, president of the mobile devices business, told Bloomberg News in a separate interview.\n\nThe Edge will use some of the same technologies as the new Ultra model, but fit them inside a slimmed-down design. Customers want the \u201cbest performance, the best camera features, the best AI, but at the same time they want an even more attractive form factor that stands out among the pack,\u201d Roh said in the interview.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been trying to combine all the advantages of the S25 Ultra in a slimmer form factor,\u201d he said.\n\nFor Apple, a skinny model is its latest attempt to find a new phone size that consumers embrace. In recent years, it has offered a mini iPhone and a Plus model, but neither of them were big hits. The Plus version will be replaced by this new thinner variant, which some are dubbing the iPhone Air, Bloomberg News has reported.

This could negatively impact Apple's stock price in the short term as it suggests a loss of innovation leadership in a key product category. However, the article also mentions Apple is planning a similar product, mitigating some of the negative impact. The actual impact will depend on the market's perception of Samsung's product and Apple's response. Given that Apple is also developing a similar product, the negative impact is likely to be moderate. The market may also see this as increased competition, which could be viewed negatively. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a stock price fall than a rise."

The impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be muted. The success of Samsung's phone is uncertain, and Apple's response is already anticipated.  The market may have already priced in the expectation of competition in this segment. Therefore, the probability of a significant price movement in either direction is relatively low. A slight negative impact is possible due to the immediate market share loss, but it's likely to be temporary and overshadowed by other factors influencing Apple's stock price."

        "headline": "Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) the Best Cash App Stock to Buy According to Hedge Funds?",
        "content": "We recently published a list of 10 Best Cash App Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other best cash app stocks to buy according to hedge funds.\n\nThe mobile payment service Cash App has grown significantly throughout the years, and in 2022 it was valued at $138 billion, up from $40 billion in 2020. Although its earnings increased to $2.95 billion, showing consistent yearly growth since 2018, its revenue decreased to $10.6 billion in 2022 from $12.3 billion in 2021, despite this remarkable valuation. Cash App\u2019s user base grew by 7 million from 2021 to 51 million in 2022, due to its user-friendly interface and array of financial services, which include peer-to-peer payments, Bitcoin investments, and cash card features. The four U.S. states of Texas, California, Florida, and New York together account for 48.75% of Cash App\u2019s user base, with over half of its customers concentrated in these states. As of 2020, there were just 10,000 active Android users in the United Kingdom, and its market share was less than 0.05%. In 2022, the platform handled more than 528 million transactions, demonstrating its increasing use. Cash App is positioned as a major participant in the digital payment ecosystem, particularly in the U.S. market, due to its excellent features and rising profitability.\n\nAs per findings by Apptopia, Cash App was the most downloaded payment app between April and May 2020, with a 20.1% increase in U.S. downloads, reaching around 4 million within that time frame. Additionally, usage increased, with roughly 250 million sessions in April\u2014the second-highest number among payment applications. As people looked for alternatives to in-person banking and provided financial support to friends and family, the pandemic caused a shift toward digital transactions, which is what is responsible for this surge.\n\nAccording to Block, Cash App\u2019s parent company, in a manner that many financial institutions have not been able to, Cash App has expanded access to the financial system and enabled a wide range of consumers to send, spend, save, invest, and comprehend their money more effectively. Its goal is to \u201credefine the world\u2019s relationship with money by making it more relatable, instantly available, and universally accessible,\u201d which is in line with this. Block believes Cash App can keep improving the economy both today and in the future.\n\nHowever, Cash App has also faced challenges. Recently, under Jack Dorsey\u2019s leadership, Block agreed to a $175 million settlement with the CFPB, which included a $55 million fine and up to $120 million in reimbursements for Cash App users. Allegations of widespread fraud and insufficient customer service on the platform were addressed in the settlement. The CFPB charged Cash App with facilitating fraud, sending users to banks, and neglecting to look into questionable transactions. Cash App accounted for over half of Block\u2019s 2023 gross profit, with over 56 million accounts. In addition, after 48 state regulators joined together, Block paid an $80 million fine for money laundering violations.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe press release stated:\n\n\u201cWhile we strongly disagree with the CFPB\u2019s mischaracterizations, we made the decision to settle this matter in the interest of putting it behind us and focusing on what\u2019s best for our customers and our business,\u201d\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article, we reviewed multiple reliable websites and videos that discuss stocks available on Cash App. From there, we formed an initial list of the 20 Best Cash App Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds. From the resultant dataset, we chose 10 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors, using Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds in Q3 2024 to gauge hedge fund sentiment for stocks.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here)Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) The Best Cash App Stock To Buy According to Hedge Funds?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nOver the years, its strong Services business segment has grown to include Apple Wallet and Apple Pay, which allow consumers to manage payments from their iPhones.\n\nBy concentrating on a high-end, intricately linked ecosystem of goods, services, and software, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has strengthened its long-term dominance in the consumer electronics sector. This ecosystem revolves around Apple\u2019s flagship iPhone, which generates 46% of the company\u2019s net sales. Giving it pricing power, switching costs, and network effects as a result. Retaining consumers inside this walled garden maximizes the benefits of all other Apple services and products. This approach gives the company room to flourish and sets it apart.\n\nFor the September quarter in Q4 of 2024, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported record revenue of $94.9 billion, up 6% year over year. This was driven by strong iPhone revenue of $46.2 billion, which climbed 6% and set a record for the September quarter across all geographic areas. Over 1 billion paid memberships throughout the firm\u2019s ecosystem contributed to a double-digit increase in services revenue, which hit a record high of $25 billion, up 12% year over year. The Apple Intelligence system, iPhone 16, Mac with M4 chips, new iPads, and improvements for the Apple Watch and AirPods were among the advances the company introduced. Furthermore, Apple broke revenue records in emerging markets, with the September quarter seeing an all-time high in India.\n\nIn terms of the environment, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) made progress toward its goal of becoming carbon-neutral throughout its whole footprint by 2030 by launching the first-ever carbon-neutral Mac and a carbon-neutral Apple Watch option. These accomplishments highlight the company\u2019s robust innovation, growth, and sustainability leadership.\n\nCDT Capital Management stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cThe crowd. While this evolution in AI is going to change the world, market expectations for the technology have become unhinged. The crowd, which is more like an exuberant mob, anointed the Mag 7 with spectacular, nonsensical valuations based on the premise that AI will be an amazing, money-printing growth engine for these companies \u2013 and the truth is it likely will be. The problem is that the math just isn\u2019t mathing.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of best cash app stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential for AAPL to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "headline": "Samsung debuts Galaxy S25 line with a heavy focus on AI",
        "content": "Samsung on Wednesday took the wraps off of its latest flagship smartphones, the Galaxy S series, during its Galaxy Unpacked event in San Jose, Calif. The latest phones are heavy on AI features, with modest hardware changes for the group.\n\nAvailable Feb. 7, the Google (GOOG, GOOGL) Android-powered lineup includes the $799 Galaxy S25, the $999 S25+, and the $1,299 S25 Ultra. The biggest differences between the phones are their screen sizes and camera arrangements. The S25 packs a 6.2-inch display, while the S25+ gets a larger 6.7-inch panel. The S25 Ultra gets a 6.9-inch screen.\n\nOn the camera front, the S25 and S25+ get 50MP wide angle, 12MP ultra-wide angle, and 10MP telephoto lenses with 3X zoom. The S25 Ultra, however, gets a 200MP wide-angle and 50MP wide-angle lenses, as well as 10MP 3x and 50MP 5x telephoto lenses.\n\nWhile hardware improvements traditionally drive sales, Samsung is leaning on AI to entice consumers to upgrade this time around. Specifically, the company points to its Galaxy AI platform and its slew of features, including the ability to interact with different apps on your behalf via AI agents.Samsung's S25 Ultra is all about the AI upgrades. (Image: Howley)\u00b7Howley\n\nUsing what Samsung calls Cross App Action along with the company\u2019s Bixby assistant and Google\u2019s built-in Gemini AI, your Galaxy S25 will be able to look up information online and use it in a separate app. So you\u2019ll be able to ask your device to look up the next Kansas City Chiefs game and add it to your calendar and it will find the date and time of the next game via Google Search and create an event for it in the Calendar app.\n\nIf you\u2019re watching a YouTube video that includes a recipe for a dish you want to make on your own, you can ask your Galaxy S25 what ingredients you\u2019ll need to get cooking and the feature will pull the list from the video and add it to your Notes app.\n\nThese kinds of generative AI capabilities could prove to be far more useful for customers than the kind of text and photo-editing tools smartphone makers rolled out in their first stab at commercializing the technology.\n\nAt launch, Samsung says Cross App Action will work with certain Samsung and Google apps, as well as some third-party apps like Spotify, and the company hopes to expand the feature by working with other developers in the near future.Samsung is adding its Now Brief to the S25 lineup, as part of its big AI push. (Image: Dan Howley)\u00b7Howley\n\nIn addition to Cross App Action, Samsung debuted what it calls its Personal Data Engine, which powers S25 features like the ability to perform AI-powered on-device searches using natural language to find photos in the Gallery app. The Personal Data Engine also powers Samsung\u2019s Now Brief, which provides you with proactive updates throughout the day including a Morning Brief and Evening Brief in the Now Bar on the lock screen.\n\nStory Continues\n\nIf you\u2019ve got a number of Samsung devices in your home, such as a smart Galaxy Ring, Samsung-compatible connected thermostat, and Samsung TV, the Personal Data Engine can combine information from those disparate sources to make helpful suggestions about how to best use them via the Now Bar.\n\nFor instance, if your Galaxy Ring, which offers sleep tracking, recognizes that you sleep better when the temperature is set to 68 degrees in your room, but the current temperature is 70 degrees, you\u2019ll receive a notification in the Now Bar suggesting you set up a routine that automatically turns the temperature down when you fall asleep at night.\n\nIf you\u2019ve got a Samsung smart TV and sleep with the TV on at night, you\u2019ll similarly get a recommendation via the Now Bar asking if you want to turn off the TV when your Galaxy Ring detects that you\u2019re snoozing.The S25 Ultra gets 5 different camera lenses including two telephoto lenses. (Image: Dan Howley)\u00b7Howley\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to use these AI features, Samsung says you\u2019ll also be able to turn off data collection at any time and delete any data if you\u2019ve already used the tool but don\u2019t want to anymore.\n\nThe personal data engine is only processed on-device, and the company says no apps can access it.\n\nAny services that use cloud-based AI, Samsung claims, provide end-to-end encryption that uses post-quantum cryptography to prevent hacking, even via quantum computing systems. Though those are still some time away from becoming a threat.\n\nAll of these new capabilities come with the regular bells and whistles Samsung includes in its yearly smartphone update, including improved processors and performance. This time around, Samsung says the S25 line will run on Qualcomm\u2019s (QCOM) latest Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chip. You\u2019ll also get a choice of 128GB or 256GB of storage with the S25 and S25+ and 128GB, 256GB, or 1TB of storage with the S25 Ultra.\n\nWhether Samsung\u2019s latest Galaxy AI features will actually get customers to buy new smartphones is an open question. AI smartphones haven\u2019t exactly sparked the kind of widespread upgrade cycles experts had predicted.\n\nApple\u2019s (AAPL) stock, for instance, was hit with two downgrades this week on fears of weaker-than-anticipated iPhone sales. Now Samsung has to prove its latest offerings are worth the price of its latest smartphones.Sign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter.\u00b7yahoofinance\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

Furthermore, the article mentions Apple's recent stock downgrades due to concerns about iPhone sales. This suggests a cautious market sentiment towards smartphone sales in general. The article does not directly mention any negative impact on Apple, but the increased competition from Samsung's AI-focused phones could potentially affect Apple's future sales and market share. However, the article also mentions that Samsung needs to prove its latest offerings are worth the price, indicating uncertainty about the success of the new phones. Given the mixed signals and the overall cautious market sentiment, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a stock price fall for Apple, but not a drastic one."

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Samsung Electronics Co. expects to enter the augmented reality glasses market in partnership with Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google, according to the company\u2019s top mobile executive, jumping into a product category that is suddenly heating up.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTexas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump Donations to LA Fire Victims Rise Past $200 Million Mark NY\u2019s Hochul Calls for Law Banning Cell Phone Use in Schools LA Schools Wrecked by Fires Plead on GoFundMe for Help to Reopen\n\nFresh off announcing a collaboration on their Project Moohan headset in December, the two companies are already working on AR glasses together, Samsung\u2019s TM Roh said in an interview. Roh, the president of Samsung\u2019s Mobile Experience division, didn\u2019t provide further details about the glasses, but said they\u2019d eventually launch as part of the company\u2019s efforts to co-develop the Android XR operating system.\n\nAs for when they would arrive in the market, Roh said the companies \u201cwill try to reach the quality and readiness we want as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nCreating true AR glasses \u2014 long the stuff of science fiction \u2014 has been an elusive goal of the technology industry. Google, Apple Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. have all sought to build a lightweight pair of spectacles that can overlay data and graphics on real-world views, but challenges related to cost and engineering have made progress slow.\n\nSuwon-based Samsung, South Korea\u2019s largest company and one of the world\u2019s most prolific smartphone makers, is looking for new engines of growth for its consumer business. The company expanded its range of wearable and health-related electronics last year with the Galaxy Ring, which tracks users\u2019 sleep, stress and exertion through the day. Android XR, which was announced as a project under development by Samsung and Google as \u201cone team,\u201d aims to deliver a unified OS for all classes of wearable headsets.\n\nAugmented reality glasses from the duo would compete with upcoming products from Meta \u2014 and potentially Apple, which has been more guarded about its plans. Meta aims to launch AR glasses dubbed Artemis in 2027, Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday.\n\nThe Project Moohan headset, meanwhile, is a mixed-reality device \u2014 one that melds AR and virtual reality. It uses outward-facing cameras to mimic an AR effect, but it\u2019s mostly a VR device that fully encompasses the user. Roh said Samsung is still trying to determine the release date and price for that product \u2014 expected this year \u2014 but the level won\u2019t be based exclusively on manufacturing costs.\n\nStory Continues\n\nOne key part of launching the headset will be securing enough content for the device, Roh said, adding that Samsung and Google are working with third parties to develop tailored original content. Apple, with its $3,500 Vision Pro, has struggled to bring enough apps and entertainment to make the device a must-have purchase.\n\n--With assistance from Debby Wu.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Kendrick Lamar Turned Beef With Drake Into Music Superstardom Elon Musk\u2019s Inaugural Highs (and Lows) Greek Police Say Eggs Were Stolen from IVF Clinic Patients Walgreens Replaced Fridge Doors With Smart Screens.

While Apple's Vision Pro is already on the market, it has faced challenges in attracting sufficient app support and achieving widespread adoption.  The entry of a major player like Samsung, with its strong brand recognition and established partnerships, increases the competitive pressure on Apple in the burgeoning AR market.  This increased competition could lead to slower-than-expected sales for Apple's Vision Pro and potentially impact investor sentiment. However, the impact is likely to be moderate because the AR market is still relatively nascent, and Apple's overall financial health and diverse product portfolio mitigate the risk.  The news is not overwhelmingly negative, as it simply highlights increased competition, not a significant threat to Apple's core business."

Balancing work and home is incredibly overwhelming, and we\u2019re all looking for ways to help us juggle life\u2019s demands.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve reached a point now where AI has evolved to become a companion \u2013 it\u2019s knowing intuitively what you need, and when. It\u2019s lightening your load so you can focus on the things that matter, at your own pace.\n\n\u201cIn many ways, it\u2019s becoming a pocket personal assistant for people, helping you manage your to-do lists.\n\n\u201cThe speed at which it\u2019s changing how we live is astonishing.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a year into Galaxy AI and it\u2019s rolling out nearly up to eight times faster than the internet when it first launched in Britain \u2013 which is something we all use every day.\u201d\n\nThe company confirmed the S25 would start at \u00a3979, the S25+ at \u00a3999 and the S25 Ultra \u2013 which comes with Samsung\u2019s S Pen stylus built-in \u2013 would start at \u00a31,249.\n\nIndustry expert and analyst Ben Wood from CCS Insight said Samsung was \u201cdoubling down\u201d on AI with some \u201cclever enhancements\u201d in the S25 range, but said some consumers were still to be convinced by the technology.\n\n\u201cLaunching new flagship smartphones has become a considerable headache for all the leading smartphone manufacturers,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cTop-end products are now so good that it\u2019s extremely difficult to deliver any meaningful differentiation from one year to the next. Samsung is not alone in this challenge, with Apple and all the other Android smartphone manufacturers in the same boat.\n\n\u201cLaunches are now characterised by \u2018slightly better everything\u2019, be that screen technology, battery life, processor performance, camera specs and more.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s little surprise that phone makers are hoping that a little \u2018AI magic dust\u2019 will help turn consumers heads, but that\u2019s proving to be a tough sell too.\n\n\u201cAt a time when improvements to hardware capabilities and product design are largely incremental, Samsung is doubling down on its AI story.\n\n\u201cThere are some clever enhancements included in the Galaxy S25 line-up, but it\u2019s unlikely they\u2019ll be enough to have consumers rushing out to upgrade their phones prematurely.\n\n\u201cHowever, this is far from being a unique issue for Samsung. Apple is facing the same challenges with the iPhone 16 and Apple Intelligence. AI is a boon for someone who needs an upgrade, but not enough to move the needle for consumers who have a relatively up-to-date phone already.\u201d\n\nView Comments",

        "headline": "Apple, Indonesia Near Agreement to Lift iPhone 16 Sales Ban, Bloomberg Report Says",
        "content": "Apple Inc. (AAPL, Financials) is allegedly close to settling a spat with Indonesia that stopped importing its iPhone 16 series, therefore stopping sales of the product. Bloomberg reports that Indonesian authorities expect a settlement within weeks that would allay worries about the company's adherence to local investment rules.\n\nImplemented in October 2024, the restriction was related to Indonesia's local content policies, which demand that certain of cellphones or their components be produced locally. Apple's first promised $10 million in funding was judged insufficient, hence the government decided to limit iPhone 16 sales. Apple responded by increasing their suggested expenditure to $1 billion, including intentions for an AirTag facility. Still, the presence of AirTagsclassified as accessories rather than necessary smartphone componentsdid not satisfy legal requirements.\n\nAs reported by Bloomberg, Indonesian Investment Minister Rosan Roeslani showed hope for a resolution of the problem. The minister said that differences in local content requirement computation have been found and are under correction. The fix would allow Apple to satisfy the necessary criteria and start national iPhone 16 series sales once again.\n\nReaching a deal might allow Apple to once again access one of the biggest consumer markets in Southeast Asia, hence increasing sales in the area, according to the report.\n\nApple has not yet commented on the topic.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

                "reasoning": "The news indicates that Apple is close to resolving a significant issue that has hindered the sales of its iPhone 16 series in Indonesia, a major consumer market. The potential lifting of the sales ban is likely to have a positive impact on Apple's revenue and market presence in the region. Given the importance of Indonesia as a market and the positive tone of the news regarding a resolution, it is reasonable to estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising. However, the uncertainty remains until an official agreement is reached, which introduces some risk of a price fall if the situation does not resolve favorably."

                "reasoning": "The news suggests a positive development for Apple. Resolving the import ban in Indonesia would allow Apple to access a significant consumer market in Southeast Asia, potentially boosting sales. While the initial investment offer was deemed insufficient, Apple's increased investment proposal and ongoing negotiations indicate a willingness to comply with local regulations. The Indonesian Investment Minister's optimism further strengthens the likelihood of a resolution. However, the lack of official comment from Apple introduces some uncertainty. Given the potential for increased sales and the positive tone of the news, a rise in stock price is more probable than a fall. The impact is likely to be moderate, as Indonesia is not Apple's largest market, and the issue has been ongoing for some time, meaning some of this information may already be priced in."

Resolving this issue would allow Apple to resume iPhone 16 sales in Indonesia, boosting revenue and potentially increasing investor confidence. While the news is positive, the impact on Apple's overall stock price might be relatively small given the size of Apple's global operations.  The Indonesian market, while important, is not large enough to significantly alter Apple's overall financial performance.  The probability of a price rise is therefore higher, but not overwhelmingly so, as the market may have already partially priced in the potential resolution.  The probability of a price fall is low, as the news is largely positive and the potential negative impact is limited."

        "headline": "Intel races to find its next CEO, but insiders say no clear frontrunners yet",
        "content": "Intel (INTC) is racing against the clock to find a new chief executive who can launch the company into the artificial intelligence age \u2014 or risk sinking further into irrelevance.\n\nA series of strategic missteps dating back to the early 2000s and a failure to build cutting-edge technologies culminated in the once-dominant chipmaker\u2019s dramatic crash in 2024, when its stock plummeted 55%.\n\nIts board ousted CEO Pat Gelsinger in December and appointed two temporary co-CEOs.\n\nThe move laid bare the board\u2019s lack of a coherent strategy and called into question the fate of Gelsinger's bold turnaround plan: Opening up Intel\u2019s manufacturing business to make chips for external customers (i.e. operating a foundry).\n\n\u201c I think it's the board that should have been fired, not him,\u201d analyst William Lazonick, who has written extensively on Intel for the Institute of New Economic Thinking, told Yahoo Finance.\n\nSince Gelsinger\u2019s exit, the board has brought on two semiconductor experts, former ASML CEO Eric Meurice and Microchip chairman Steve Sanghi. Prior to their addition, only two of the 11 board members had semiconductor industry experience, per Citi analyst Christopher Danley.\n\nA Wall Street Intel analyst said Meurice and Sanghi are \"already ... challenging the plans [and] the processes within Intel.\" They asked to remain anonymous because they were not authorized to speak publicly on the topic.\n\nIntel declined to comment on its CEO search.\n\nYahoo Finance spoke to analysts and several former high-level Intel executives, who offered their insights on who Intel\u2019s board might select to take the helm of America\u2019s only large-scale, leading-edge chip manufacturer.\n\nThe aforementioned Intel analyst told Yahoo Finance that temporary co-CEO David Zinsner \u201cdoesn't want the job.\u201d Several people with knowledge of the situation said Zinsner\u2019s counterpart, Michelle Johnston Holthaus, is being considered for the role. A former executive said the Intel veteran, who heads its products group, \"has a shot.\"\n\nThe former executive and another former high-level executive from Intel's manufacturing division critiqued Holthaus as lacking technical skill \u2014 a quality that analysts and Intel insiders agree is a must-have in its next leader.\n\n\u201c She never has an independent idea. She never drives an agenda,\u201d one of the former executives said. Intel describes Holthaus as \u201ca proven general manager and leader.\u201d\n\nMoor Insights & Strategy analyst Anshel Sag said the chipmaker will likely choose someone currently outside the company, but the decision will take a while.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u201cAs someone who's very tightly connected within the company, I have not gotten the feeling that they are even remotely close to picking someone,\u201d Sag told Yahoo Finance.\n\nBloomberg, citing unnamed sources, reported that Intel\u2019s external candidates include former Cadence Design Systems (CDNS) CEO Lip-Bu Tan, Marvell Technology (MRVL) CEO Matt Murphy, Intel board member Stacy Smith, Ampere Computing founder Renee James, Apple's (AAPL) internal chip head Johny Srouji, Analog Devices (ADI) exec Gregory Bryant, and Lenovo\u2019s (0992.HK) Kirk Skaugen.\n\nFive of those \u201coutsiders\u201d previously worked at Intel. Several of them spent more than a decade at the company and were pushed out under former CEO Brian Krzanich.\n\nThe Intel analyst also mentioned Boeing (BA) chair and former Qualcomm (QCOM) CEO Steve Mollenkopf and Eclipse Ventures general partner Sanjay Jha as potential candidates.\n\nSources have mixed opinions on whether it should hire an insider who knows the company well.\n\n\"Intel needs to be examined by a fresh set of eyes unburdened by prior affiliations,\" Futurum Group analyst David Nicholson told Yahoo Finance.\n\nBernstein semiconductor analyst Stacy Rasgon said Lip-Bu Tan is the candidate \u201ca lot of shareholders would love to see\u201d fill the role. Tan previously served on Intel\u2019s board but stepped down in August because he disagreed with Intel\u2019s foundry strategy \u2014 a plan that was aggressively pursued by Gelsinger. Former executives agreed that Tan is \u201cwell-respected\u201d and, in many ways, an ideal person for the role.\n\n\u201cLip-Bu knows how to do a turnaround, how to reinvent a business, how to incentivize change. He also knows how resistant Intel is to change,\u201d the aforementioned Intel manufacturing executive told Yahoo Finance.\n\nYet according to analysts, Tan would not be interested in such a leadership role at this point in his career. Tan also sits on the board of Gelsinger's Christian organization.\n\nOne of the former high level executives with knowledge of the matter said that Tan is still deciding whether he would consider taking the role.\n\nOne of the five former Intel insiders is AI startup Ampere founder Renee James, who was described by two of the former executives as \u201cstrategically brilliant\u201d and \u201cexecution-oriented.\u201d\n\nHowever, one of the sources, who worked at the company for decades, said that James does not have a good enough relationship with the board to be a top pick.\n\nStacy Smith \u2014 an Intel board member who previously worked at the company for nearly 30 years, including as CFO for roughly a decade \u2014 was described by the former Intel manufacturing executive as \u201ctrusted, respected, well-liked.\u201d\n\nSmith recently oversaw the IPO of Japanese company Toshiba\u2019s chip business as its executive chair, which was rebranded as Kioxia in recent years. The completion of Kioxia\u2019s IPO opens the door for Smith to take the Intel job, one of the former executives said.\n\nFormer executives also spoke highly of Kirk Skaugen, a former engineer who served in executive roles across Intel\u2019s PC and data center business. Apple's Srouji and Marvell's Murphy are both well-versed in semiconductors, but sources doubt either will take the top job.\n\nWall Street has mixed views on how long the CEO search will take. In a client note on Jan. 8, Danley suggested that the process could wrap up \u201cwithin the next couple of months,\u201d writing that \u201cthe company is relatively far along in the process.\u201d Meanwhile, KeyBanc\u2019s John Vinh wrote in his own note the same day that the process would likely take four to six months.\n\n\u201cThe board is currently looking at external candidates with no hard timelines,\u201d Vinh said.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(INTC)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nLast Friday, Intel\u2019s stock popped on a report that an unnamed company is trying to acquire the company. Analyst Dylan Patel suggested Elon Musk, while Citi wrote that Broadcom (AVGO) would be the most likely buyer. Last year, Qualcomm reportedly explored an acquisition before interest cooled off.\n\nIntel did not respond to a request for comment on the acquisition rumors.\n\nMeanwhile, US officials are eyeing a merger between US-based chip manufacturer GlobalFoundries and Intel, per Bloomberg.\n\nBut until a new CEO can be found, the chips giant is at a standstill. \u201cThe interim CEOs \u2026 will avoid altering the overall grand strategy in irreversible ways,\u201d KeyBanc analyst Vinh added in his note.StockStory aims to help individual investors beat the market.\n\nYasmin Khorram is a senior reporter at Yahoo Finance.

This could be interpreted in two ways: 1) Srouji leaving Apple could negatively impact Apple's chip development, or 2) Srouji staying at Apple reinforces Apple's commitment to its current strategy. The article also mentions that Intel is at a standstill until a new CEO is found. This could be seen as a positive for Apple, as it gives Apple a competitive advantage. However, the overall impact on Apple is likely to be minimal. Therefore, the probabilities are close to 50/50, with a slight edge towards a neutral to slightly positive impact."

The ongoing search itself represents a period of uncertainty for Intel, which could negatively impact investor confidence.  The mention of potential acquisitions of Intel is a separate factor that could lead to a stock price increase, but the uncertainty surrounding the CEO search overshadows this possibility in the short term.  The news is primarily about Intel, and its impact on Apple (AAPL) is indirect and minimal.  The only connection is the mention of Apple's Johny Srouji as a potential candidate for Intel's CEO position. However, the article suggests this is unlikely.

        "content": "When a mother in New York City realized her son's iPhone was missing, she did what many parents would do \u2013 she immediately opened Apple's Find My app to track the device. What she discovered was both frustrating and fascinating, as the stolen iPhone went on an international adventure highlighting just how organized the black market for stolen electronics has become.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nThe average American couple has saved this much money for retirement \u2014 How do you compare? Can you guess how many Americans successfully retire with $1,000,000 saved? The percentage may shock you.\n\nFrom NYC to Shenzhen\n\nThe phone's journey began on Oct. 30 in NYC when it was snatched. First, it appeared in an apartment complex in the Bronx, then sat in a Long Island warehouse for a few days. Months later, it resurfaced nearly 8,000 miles away in Shenzhen, China, a well-known city hub for electronics manufacturing and repair.\n\nBy this point, the device was locked and useless to whoever had it, thanks to Apple's Activation Lock \u2013 a feature designed to prevent thieves from resetting and reselling stolen phones. Despite this, the phone's destination made sense. Shenzhen is home to Huaqiangbei, a sprawling electronics market where stolen phones are dismantled for parts or reassembled into \u201cnew\u201d devices.\n\nThe Scale of the Problem\n\nSmartphone theft is a widespread issue in the United States. Allstate estimates that 5% or an estimated 14.7 million phones were stolen in 2023 alone. Since iPhones make up about 50% of the smartphone market in the U.S., this translates to approximately 7.35 million stolen iPhones in a year. The financial damage is immense, not just in the cost of the devices but also in the security risks posed by potential data breaches.\n\nSee Also: \u2018Scrolling To UBI' \u2014 Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones. You can invest today for just $0.26/share with a $1000 minimum.\n\nWhat Frustrated Her Most\n\nOddly enough, losing the iPhone wasn't the most infuriating part of the ordeal. What truly upset the mother was the lack of interest from local authorities. She filed a police report with the NYPD immediately after the theft, but the response was underwhelming. Even when the phone's location was trackable in NYC, nothing was done to investigate.\n\n\"I'm not that mad about losing this one phone,\" she shared, \"but I wish the NYPD had looked into the Long Island warehouse before it left NY. I bet there are a ton of other phones going through this same path.\" Her frustration resonated with others online, as many shared similar stories of police apathy toward stolen phones.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAs one person said, \u201cAnd I thought only in India police are not interested in stolen phone cases. Well, this has been the same for the entire world. Looks like a nexus to bring the phone to China where tracking is difficult because of the poor treaty.\u201d\n\nAnother tried explaining things further: \u201cPeople don't understand that filing a police report is literally just a report. It's not a request for the police to look into it or a declaration by the police that they will look into it.\u201d\n\nTrending: Maker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing \u2014 you can become an investor for $0.80 per share today.\n\nHow the Black Market Thrives\n\nShenzhen's Huaqiangbei district has become a hotbed for dismantling stolen devices. While Apple's Activation Lock, part of its Stolen Device Protection measures, makes it nearly impossible to reuse an iPhone, individual components like screens, batteries and chips can still be salvaged and sold.\n\nIn some cases, thieves even scam the original owners into removing the Activation Lock by sending fake messages claiming to be from Apple. Or, as someone said, \u201cHe'll start getting messages from someone claiming that they bought it and need him to remove the activation lock. Don't do it. Block and ignore. Eventually, they'll start threatening him. Again, ignore. They can't do anything.\u201d\n\nOrganized networks route phones from theft hotspots like NYC to international markets, with Shenzhen being one of the biggest destinations.\n\nThese operations are so well-oiled that stolen phones are often shipped in bulk, passing through intermediaries.\n\nRead Next:\n\nMany are using retirement income calculators to check if they\u2019re on pace \u2014 here\u2019s a breakdown on what\u2019s behind this formula.

Overall, while the news is negative in terms of theft, it does not directly impact Apple's financial performance or product demand.

The article also mentions the large scale of smartphone theft, with iPhones making up a significant portion. The mother's frustration with the lack of police action could reflect a broader public perception of the issue. However, the article doesn't directly impact Apple's revenue or profitability in a significant way. The Activation Lock is working as intended, and the theft issue is a general problem in the smartphone industry, not specific to Apple. The negative aspects are balanced by the positive aspect of Apple's security features working. Therefore, the impact on the stock price is likely to be minimal. I am assigning a slightly higher probability to a stock price fall due to the negative sentiment associated with theft and potential security concerns, but the overall impact is expected to be small."

        "content": "Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) edged higher Thursday after reports indicated the company is close to resolving its dispute with Indonesia, which has blocked iPhone 16 sales over local investment rules. Investment Minister Rosan Roeslani told Bloomberg in Davos that he expects a resolution within one to two weeks.\n\nThe government had previously rejected Apple's $1 billion investment plan, which included an AirTag factory, saying it did not meet local content requirements for smartphone production. Indonesia first imposed the ban in October 2024, citing Apple's failure to meet investment thresholds. The company initially offered $100 million over two years, later increasing the bid to $1 billion.\n\nReports last month suggested President Prabowo Subianto approved the latest proposal, paving the way for a deal. Roeslani said the government and Apple are now working through differences in how local content is calculated and expressed confidence that an agreement will soon allow iPhone 16 sales to resume in the Southeast Asian market.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

A $1 billion investment deal nearing completion suggests a positive outcome for Apple, potentially unlocking a substantial market. While the exact impact on Apple's overall revenue is uncertain, the removal of a sales ban in a growing market is generally viewed favorably by investors.  However, the market may have already partially priced in this positive outcome given previous reports suggesting President Prabowo Subianto's approval. Therefore, while a price rise is likely, the magnitude might be less than if this news were entirely unexpected.  There's a small chance the deal could still fall through, leading to a slight price drop, although this seems less probable given the optimistic statements from Indonesian officials."

        "content": "Warren Buffett Once Claimed iPhones Are So Great That No One Would Take $10,000 To Stop Buying Them\n\nWarren Buffett, one of the most famous investors ever, has long admired Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and thinks it\u2019s one of the best companies in the world. He once made a bold claim that perfectly illustrates how much people love their iPhones.\n\nIn 2023, Buffett told CNBC\u2019s Squawk Box, \"If you're an Apple user and somebody offers you $10,000, but the only proviso is they'll take away your iPhone and you'll never be able to buy another, you're not going to take it.\" He believes people value their iPhones so much that even $10,000 wouldn't convince them to give them up forever.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\n\u2018Scrolling To UBI' \u2014 Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones. You can invest today for just $0.26/share with a $1000 minimum. According to Juniper Research, the total value of B2B cross-border payments stored on the blockchain is projected to exceed $4.4 trillion \u2014 Join the first company to bring blockchain payments to Salesforce early with just $100.\n\nApple's Unmatched Loyalty\n\nBuffett says Apple is special because it creates products that people truly enjoy. The iPhone is not just a phone \u2013 it's an experience many users see as part of their daily lives. Even though there are other phones with cool features \u2013 like better cameras, folding screens or advanced AI \u2013 none give the same smooth and simple experience as iPhones.\n\nIt's not just the usability. Owning an iPhone makes people feel connected to a larger community. Giving up an iPhone, as Buffett suggested, means stepping out of a social circle and giving up the ecosystem that so many users find irreplaceable.\n\nOn the other hand, he said, \"If they tell you if you buy another Ford Motor car, they'll give you $10,000 not to do that, you'll take the $10,000 and buy a Chevy instead.\"\n\nSee Also: With 100+ historic trademark victories, this company holds IP for some of the highest-grossing characters in history.

There\u2019s now a limited window for investors to claim shares at just $2/share with $980 minimum\u2014but the clock is ticking.\n\nA Changing Landscape\n\nDespite Apple's stronghold on customer loyalty, the company has faced recent challenges. In 2024, iPhone sales in China dropped by 17%, marking the biggest annual sales drop Apple has seen in the country. It even lost its market leadership to local competitors like Huawei and Vivo. The broader Chinese smartphone market grew 4% during the same period, showing Apple's struggle to keep up with innovative, domestically produced alternatives.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple offered rare discounts on its iPhone 16 models in China to fight back. However, competition from foldable and AI-powered phones made by other brands continues to challenge Apple.\n\nTrending: This 12,000 RPM Spinning Battery With Over $100 Million In LOIs Could Be The Missing Link For Green Energy \u2014 Here\u2019s Why Early Investors Are Flocking To Invest Before Funding Closes\n\nBuffett's Evolving Strategy\n\nInterestingly, Buffett's actions regarding Apple have raised eyebrows. Berkshire Hathaway, the investment firm he leads, recently reduced its Apple stake by 25%, leaving it with 300 million shares. While Apple still accounts for 26% of Berkshire's portfolio, the sale reflects Buffett's commitment to his value investing principles \u2013 he's always looking for quality investments at a fair price.\n\nThis sale helped Berkshire build up $325 billion in cash, the most it's ever had. Some experts think Buffett is preparing for a possible market downturn or making things easier for the next leader of Berkshire Hathaway.\n\nRead Next:\n\nDeloitte's fastest-growing software company partners with Amazon, Walmart & Target \u2013 Many are rushing to grab 4,000 of its pre-IPO shares for just $0.26/share!

The reduction in stake by Berkshire Hathaway, even though Apple still constitutes a significant portion of their portfolio, is a stronger signal than Buffett's past comments.

Buffett's recent reduction of Berkshire Hathaway's Apple stake also introduces uncertainty. While the anecdote might offer a short-term positive sentiment boost, the long-term implications of the Chinese market struggles and Buffett's divestment are more significant.  The probability of a price rise is therefore tempered by the negative factors.  The overall impact is likely to be muted, with a slightly higher probability of a price fall due to the weight of the negative news."

                "reasoning": "The opening of the Apple Miami Worldcenter is a positive development for Apple Inc., as it enhances their retail presence in a vibrant market and showcases their commitment to sustainability and accessibility. The store's features, such as the dedicated Apple Pickup area and community engagement events, are likely to attract customers and drive sales, particularly with the launch of new products like the iPhone 16. This news is expected to have a favorable impact on investor sentiment, leading to a higher probability of stock price increase. However, the overall market conditions and other external factors could still influence stock performance, hence a small probability of decline is also considered."

                "reasoning": "The news indicates the opening of a new Apple store in a prominent location. This is generally a positive sign, suggesting continued growth and investment in retail presence. The store's design emphasizes sustainability and accessibility, aligning with Apple's brand image and potentially attracting environmentally and socially conscious consumers. The mention of the iPhone 16 and M4 chip-powered Macs suggests continued product innovation. The special programming and community events aim to drive traffic and engagement. However, the impact of a single store opening on a company as large as Apple is likely to be marginal. Therefore, while the news is positive, it's unlikely to cause a significant surge in the stock price. The probabilities are adjusted accordingly, favoring a slight rise but acknowledging the limited impact."

                "reasoning": "The opening of a new Apple store in a vibrant location like downtown Miami is generally considered positive news.  It signifies continued retail expansion and brand strength. However, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal.  Apple is a massive company, and the revenue generated by a single new store, even in a major city, is unlikely to significantly affect the overall financial performance.  The news is more of a positive PR event than a major financial catalyst. Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than the probability of a fall, but both probabilities remain close to neutral, reflecting the limited impact of this specific event on Apple's overall valuation."

While this is a positive development showcasing Apple's brand strength and retail innovation, it is unlikely to have a significant immediate impact on the stock price. Retail store openings are routine for Apple and are already factored into long-term growth expectations. The news does not include any unexpected financial metrics, product launches, or strategic shifts that would materially alter investor sentiment. Therefore, the market reaction is likely to be neutral or slightly positive, but not dramatic."

The new store offers the full lineup of Apple products, features an industry-leading environmental store design, and provides exceptional customer support. The store's focus on accessibility and environmental sustainability aligns with Apple's values and could enhance the company's brand image. However, the impact on stock price is typically more significantly influenced by factors like sales figures, earnings reports, and broader market trends rather than the opening of a single retail location. Therefore, while the news is positive, it is unlikely to cause a significant stock price movement. The probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall, but both probabilities are relatively low."

The store's focus on environmental sustainability, accessibility, and community engagement aligns with Apple's values and may appeal to customers. Additionally, the store's location in a vibrant downtown area and its offer of the full lineup of Apple products may attract new customers and increase sales. However, the impact of a single store opening on the company's overall stock price may be limited.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- The Nasdaq 100 Index has nearly doubled since the start of 2023, adding $14 trillion in value in the process. Evercore ISI\u2019s Rich Ross is prepared for that rally to continue, shrugging off fears of a familiar nemesis: rising bond yields.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTexas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump Donations to LA Fire Victims Rise Past $200 Million Mark NY\u2019s Hochul Calls for Law Banning Cell Phone Use in Schools LA Schools Wrecked by Fires Plead on GoFundMe for Help to Reopen\n\nTreasury rates jumped to multi-month highs last week as investors parsed economic data for clues on the Federal Reserve\u2019s next interest-rate cut following US President Donald Trump\u2019s election victory. The win ignited bets that his economic plans \u2014 like large import tariffs and mass deportations of low-wage undocumented workers \u2014 would stoke inflation and hurt growth, reducing the Fed\u2019s scope to lower borrowing costs. That\u2019s dented the appeal of rate-sensitive sectors, especially those with elevated valuations like technology.\n\nThe yield on the US 10-year has since pulled back after hitting a relative strength reading that usually signals a retreat. Pair that with positive technical signals and the Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 Index both appear poised to hit fresh all-time highs in the first quarter, according to Ross, Evercore ISI\u2019s head of technical analysis.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day technology remains in an outstanding position to continue to lead this market higher,\u201d Ross said.\n\nThrough Tuesday, the tech-heavy equities benchmark has gone 467 sessions trading above its 200-day moving average \u2014 the second-longest such streak since the index\u2019s inception four decades ago, according to data compiled by Bloomber.\n\nThe gauge currently trades around 10% above that long-term support level, a signal of relative stability to technical analysts who monitor daily averages and other metrics to determine stock-market momentum. This comes after the benchmark rose as much as 20% above that line in July \u2014 a level that preceded a summer rout and has historically foretold past selloffs.\n\nThe weeks ahead will be a pivotal stretch for stocks as Big Tech companies gear up to report quarterly earnings and the Fed\u2019s next policy decision looms on Jan. 29. With earnings season already underway, investors are listening for how corporate chiefs expect the coming months to look. Next week is the busiest of the season, with reports coming from the likes of Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc.\n\nStory Continues\n\nTo gauge where the 100-member index goes from here, John Kolovos, head of technical strategy at Macro Risk Advisors, is monitoring the largest exchange-traded fund tracking the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ). He sees technical supports between $485 and $495, around the ETF\u2019s November lows. In his view, any pullbacks that are still above those thresholds provide a dip-buying opportunity.\n\n\u201cFalling yields are good for market breadth and equity-market participation,\u201d said Kolovos. Technical analysts are also watching for whether Apple will catch a bid as the iPhone maker nears its 200-DMA.\n\nAfter the yield on the 10-year Treasury briefly topped 4.8% last week \u2014 above its 2024 high \u2014 its fallen more than 20 basis points since then to hover around 4.57% on Tuesday. For Kolovos, the next key support level on the benchmark note\u2019s rate is 4.5%, near its 50-DMA and a November peak. He\u2019s also watching 4.8% and the late 2023 highs at 5% for resistance. The 10-year yield\u2019s 14-day relative strength reading topped the 70 level two weeks ago, which some technicians view as a sign of overheating.\n\nWith the Nasdaq 100 roughly 2.4% below its December record, semiconductor stocks \u2014 a high-conviction idea from Evercore ISI\u2019s Ross \u2014 are making fresh highs relative to software shares, suggesting that traders are rotating back into the chipmakers like Nvidia Corp. that have powered the bull market\u2019s advance for more than two years.\n\nIn fact, the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH), which holds chip bellwethers like Nvidia, Applied Materials Inc. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc., has outperformed the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) in five of the past six weeks, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\n\n\u201cHigher rates weigh uniquely on smaller caps and cyclicals such that when we get relief from rates, the first response is to buy back those hard hit groups,\u201d Ross said. \u201cWhen the dust settles, we go right back to those strong secular trends, big cash piles and big moats offered by Big Tech.\u201d\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Kendrick Lamar Turned Beef With Drake Into Music Superstardom Elon Musk\u2019s Inaugural Highs (and Lows) Greek Police Say Eggs Were Stolen from IVF Clinic Patients Walgreens Replaced Fridge Doors With Smart Screens.

Additionally, the upcoming earnings reports from major tech companies, including Apple, could further influence stock prices positively. Given these factors, the probability of Apple's stock price rising appears higher than that of it falling."

Technical analysts are also watching for Apple to 'catch a bid' as it nears its 200-DMA.

The article specifically highlights the expectation that Apple, along with other tech giants, will report strong earnings.

The analyst also suggests that the growth potential for Apple in China is uncertain, leading to a cautious outlook. While there is mention of future positive developments in AI and hardware, the immediate impact seems negative."

        "content": "Nancy Pelosi Sells Nvidia, Apple And Loads Up On Google-Parent Alphabet And Amazon Calls\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nFormer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has executed a series of significant technology stock trades valued at over $30 million, according to recent congressional disclosure reports, while recovering from a hip injury sustained during an official trip to Luxembourg.\n\nWhat Happened: Pelosi\u2019s latest trading activity includes substantial positions in major tech companies through options contracts. On Jan. 14, she purchased 50 call options each in Google-parent Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), with each position valued between $250,001 and $500,000.\n\nThe contracts expire in January 2026 with strike prices of $150.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nMaker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing \u2014 you can become an investor for $0.80 per share today. If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?\n\nThe former Speaker\u2019s largest recent transaction was a sale of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares on Dec. 31, disposing of 31,600 shares valued between $5 million and $25 million. On the same day, she sold 10,000 shares of NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) worth between $1 million and $5 million.\n\nThese trades follow Pelosi\u2019s hospitalization in Luxembourg, where she was treated for a hip fracture sustained during the 80th-anniversary commemoration of the Battle of the Bulge.

The performance has reignited debates about congressional stock trading, with critics calling for stricter regulations.\n\nIn September, President Donald Trump questioned the timing of Pelosi\u2019s previous trades, particularly regarding Visa Inc.

                "reasoning": "Nancy Pelosi's sale of Apple shares, valued between $5 million and $25 million, may signal a lack of confidence in the stock's short-term performance, which could lead to negative sentiment among investors. However, the overall market reaction to her trading activities could be mixed, as her trades have historically garnered attention and speculation. The news does not indicate any fundamental issues with Apple itself, but the timing of her sale may lead to a perception of weakness. Therefore, while there is a chance of a price decline due to her selling activity, the overall impact may not be severe, leading to a moderate probability of a price fall."

                "reasoning": "Nancy Pelosi's stock trades are often viewed as a signal, although their actual impact is debatable. Her selling of Apple shares could be interpreted negatively by some investors, potentially leading to a slight decrease in demand. However, Apple's overall performance and market sentiment are much larger factors. The news also mentions her selling Nvidia, which is not relevant to Apple's stock price prediction. The fact that she is buying Google and Amazon calls is not directly related to Apple's stock. The article also mentions that a Pelosi stock tracker has outperformed hedge funds, which could lead to some investors following her moves, but this is speculative. Overall, the news is a minor negative signal, but unlikely to cause a significant drop. Therefore, the probability of a fall is slightly higher than a rise, but both are close to 50%."

                "reasoning": "Nancy Pelosi's sale of Apple shares is the key piece of information. While the sale itself might suggest a negative outlook, the context is crucial.  The article highlights that a stock tracker following Pelosi's trades performed exceptionally well in 2024 (54% gain), suggesting her trades aren't necessarily indicative of market movements.  Furthermore, the sale was a significant portion of her holdings, and it occurred alongside other trades (buying calls on Alphabet and Amazon).  This suggests a portfolio rebalancing rather than a bearish signal specifically for Apple.  The overall impact on Apple's stock price from this news is likely to be minimal, with the market already pricing in much larger factors. Therefore, the probabilities are weighted towards a neutral outcome."

Given her historical influence and the perception that her trades might signal insider sentiment, this sale could be interpreted negatively by the market. While Pelosi's trades are not definitive indicators of future stock performance, the optics of a high-profile sale may lead to temporary bearish sentiment among some investors. However, Apple's stock price is influenced by a wide range of factors, including broader market conditions, company earnings, and product innovation, which may mitigate the impact of this news. Moreover, the sale was executed as part of a larger portfolio reallocation toward Alphabet and Amazon call options, suggesting a sector rotation rather than a specific bearish outlook on Apple."

The sale of Apple shares by a high-profile investor could be perceived as a negative signal by the market, potentially leading to a decrease in investor confidence and, consequently, a fall in the stock price. However, it's also possible that this sale is merely a portfolio adjustment and not a direct reflection of the company's performance.

Additionally, the article mentions that a Nancy Pelosi stock tracker delivered 54% gains in 2024, which may suggest that her trades are not entirely driven by insider information.

Just 8.5% of the analysts tracked by Bloomberg have a bearish rating, while about 63% have the equivalent of a buy.\n\nJefferies analyst Edison Lee writes that recent weakness in iPhone sales has been worse than expected, with the China market a particular concern. Independent research indicates that iPhone sales sank 18.2% in China during the December quarter, while global unit sales fell about 5% in the final quarter of last year amid higher China competition.\n\nCiting a third-party survey, Lee added that \u201cUS consumers do not yet find smartphone AI useful,\u201d meaning that it is \u201cunlikely to kickstart a super upgrade cycle anytime soon.\u201d Given these trends, he wrote, Apple\u2019s March quarter guidance could disappoint.\n\nSeparately, Loop expects a \u201cmaterial iPhone demand reduction\u201d beginning in the March quarter \u201cbut materially amplifying\u201d in the subsequent two quarters.

                "reasoning": "The news is overwhelmingly negative for Apple. Multiple analyst downgrades citing weak iPhone sales, particularly in China, and a lack of AI-driven upgrade cycle are significant concerns. The stock has already experienced a substantial decline in January. The downgrades from Jefferies and Loop Capital, along with MoffettNathanson earlier in the month, indicate a growing consensus of negative sentiment. The fact that Apple lost its top-stock crown to Nvidia further underscores the shift in investor perception. The upcoming earnings report next week adds further uncertainty, with analysts suggesting a potential disappointment. The replacement of Apple by Seagate Technology as Morgan Stanley's top pick in IT hardware is another negative signal. While a small percentage of analysts still have a buy rating, the overall trend is downward, and the consensus recommendation is at its lowest since May.

Analyst downgrades from Jefferies (to underperform) and Loop Capital (to hold) further amplify negative sentiment.  The cited 18.2% drop in iPhone sales in China during the December quarter and the belief that AI won't significantly boost sales in the near term paint a bleak picture for the short-term outlook.  While the overall analyst sentiment still leans slightly bullish (63% buy ratings), the recent downgrades and the significant drop in Apple's market capitalization suggest a heightened risk of further price declines in the short term.

While Apple doesn't release specific financial details for its streaming service, the reported $200 million revenue from 'Severance' Season 1 and the $600 million from 'Ted Lasso' are positive indicators. The article also mentions the potential for a fourth season of 'Ted Lasso', suggesting continued success. The weekly release strategy of 'Severance' is also highlighted as a positive factor. However, it's important to remember that Apple is a massive company with diverse revenue streams. The impact of Apple TV+ on the overall stock price is likely to be relatively small. Therefore, while the news is positive, it's unlikely to cause a significant surge in the stock price. A slight positive movement is more probable than a negative one. The fact that GuruFocus is reporting on this also suggests it's considered a noteworthy, albeit not earth-shattering, development."

While Apple doesn't break down streaming service financials separately, the success of these shows contributes positively to the overall company performance.  The $200 million figure for 'Severance' is substantial, and the mention of a potential fourth season of 'Ted Lasso' further reinforces the positive impact of Apple's streaming strategy. However, the impact on Apple's overall stock price is likely to be relatively small, as Apple's revenue is dominated by its hardware and services segments. The streaming service's success is a positive indicator of future growth potential, but it's not a major game-changer in the short term.  Therefore, a slight increase in stock price is more probable than a decrease, but the effect is likely to be muted due to the relatively small contribution of Apple TV+ to Apple's overall financial picture compared to iPhone sales, for example."

        "content": "Big Tech is kissing the ring of President Donald Trump after having a contentious relationship with him in his first term.\n\nThat schmoozing was on display at Trump's inauguration as the likes of Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Google (GOOG) CEO Sundar Pichai, and Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook snatched better seats at the event than incoming cabinet members.\n\n\"I do think that in a lot of these cases, these are companies that had something that they had to fix. They had problems and potential risk that was out there. And I think they were kind of coming and saying, listen, we're willing to talk to you. We're willing to engage and at some level,\" Cloudflare co-founder and CEO Matthew Prince told Yahoo Finance at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.\n\nThe tech veteran didn't attend the inauguration but added there has been \"kind of the war on tech\" that hobbled the industry.\n\n\"The tech industry is very much like one of the US battleships. It is an incredibly powerful force for the United States, around the rest of the world,\" he said. \"I think if we actually start investing in tech, and not just the big companies, but startups, little tech, all of the different organizations that are out there, that's a huge advantage that the US has.\"\n\nCybersecurity stocks have performed relatively well since Donald Trump's election win in early November.\n\nCloudflare has outperformed its peer group, rising about 28% since Election Day. Fortinet (FTNT) is up 18%. ZScaler (ZS) is up 3%, while Palo Alto Networks (PANW) has shed 3%.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(NET)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nThe optimism could be traced to several factors.\n\nFor one, investment pros say Trump will be friendly to the cybersecurity business model. Recall that in September 2018, Trump signed off on the National Cyber Strategy. The doctrine aimed to encourage government and private investment in cybersecurity infrastructure. It also sought to bolster domestic innovation in the sector.\n\nSecond, a mega trend such as AI and potentially looser regulations around dealmaking under Trump may spur profits and valuations on the cybersecurity stocks.\n\n\"We believe the cyber security sector will have a robust 2025 and should be one of the strongest sub-sector with our view cyber security could be up 30%+ over the next year led by accelerated cloud and AI growth along with M&A we expect to be very active in this tech area,\" Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives said.\n\nAnd three, a more digital-first world is simply getting riskier by the day, pointed out the World Economic Forum in its 2025 global cybersecurity outlook report. With that comes the need to bolster cybersecurity tools at companies and governments.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\"The prevailing turmoil has affected the perception of risks, with one in three CEOs citing cyber espionage and loss of sensitive information/ intellectual property theft as their top concern, while 45% of cyber leaders are concerned about disruption of operations and business processes,\" the report said.\n\n\u2014\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

The rumored smartphone \u2014 part of the SE series of smaller iPhones \u2014 is expected to use an A18 chip that is also found in the iPhone 16, a full-screen OLED display, and artificial intelligence capabilities powered by Apple Intelligence. Analysts also noted that the SE 4 is expected to have one rear camera, while the iPhone 13 Pro and 14 Pro have three cameras.\n\n\u201cAs Apple Intelligence has yet to gain traction with consumers, a used iPhone 13 would be an attractive option to some consumers especially [because] the selling price could potentially be lower than that of SE4,\u201d Jefferies analysts said in the note.\n\nMeanwhile, iPhone shipments were down by around 4% year over year in the quarter ending in December, Jefferies said, citing data from the International Data Corporation.

        "headline": "Labour installs Amazon man at CMA as Trump threatens tech war",
        "content": "Doug Gurr ran Amazon\u2019s UK arm for nine years until 2022 - Shutterstock\n\nThe chairman of Britain\u2019s competition regulator has been ousted and replaced with a veteran Amazon executive as Donald Trump threatens a trade war with countries that seek to curb US tech giants.\n\nMinisters last night appointed Doug Gurr, who ran Amazon\u2019s UK arm for nine years until 2022, as interim chairman of the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA).\n\nHe will replace Marcus Bokkerink, who is leaving just three years into a five-year term at the watchdog, after an intervention from Jonathan Reynolds, the Business Secretary.\n\nIt is understood his exit is intended to signal that the Government is serious about its efforts to unlock growth, as the CMA has in recent years been attacked for attempting to halt a wide range of deals.\n\nThis includes an effort to block Microsoft\u2019s $69bn (\u00a356bn) takeover of gaming company Activision in 2023, which led to the former\u2019s boss Brad Smith claiming his confidence in the UK had been left \u201cseverely shaken\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, under Mr Gurr, Amazon accused the CMA of a \u201cspeculative\u201d effort to block a minority investment in the UK\u2019s Deliveroo in 2018.\n\nFive years later, Will Shu, Deliveroo chief executive, claimed the watchdog was \u201ctrying to kill companies\u201d.\n\nIndustry sources said the decision to remove Mr Bokkerink, a former consultant at Boston Consulting Group, could serve to \u201creassure\u201d the technology sector and say \u201cwe\u2019re taking growth seriously\u201d.\n\nHowever, they also pointed to the fact that Sarah Cardell, the CMA chief executive, has ultimate day-to-day responsibility for the regulator, raising questions over how she will collaborate with Mr Gurr.Sarah Cardell will retain overall responsibility for running the CMA - Betty Laura Zapata/Bloomberg\n\nClash with White House\n\nThe unexpected departure of Mr Bokkerink comes as Britain risks a clash with Mr Trump\u2019s new White House regime over its stance on global competition rules.\n\nThe CMA has already announced an investigation into Google over its search dominance this year, while The Telegraph understands it also has been preparing a second probe into the power of Apple and Google over smartphone app stores.\n\nMarc Andreessen, who donated to Mr Trump\u2019s campaign, last week said there were \u201cenormous challenges\u201d in the UK on competition rules, claiming they were \u201cextremely draconian, anti-tech, anti-business, anti-American policies\u201d.\n\nBrussels regulators have reportedly put major decisions on investigations into Apple, Meta and Google on hold \u2013 in part to assess the temperature of the Trump administration.\n\nCristina Caffarra, a competition economist, said: \u201cIf anyone tried anything that had the potential to make real change, we now know there would be unknown retribution as Trump has indicated he would protect American platforms from Europe, and they bent the knee.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u201cThere were four men [Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos and Sundar Pichai] in the front row [at Mr Trump\u2019s inauguration] worth nearly a trillion dollars, it\u2019s very clear he will protect them in some way.\u201dTech bosses Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, Sundar Pichai and Elon Musk at Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration - Julia Demaree Nikhinson/AP Photo\n\nAndrew Griffith, the shadow business secretary, said that Labour\u2019s decision to appoint Mr Gurr in the name of growth \u201cseems odd when they are simultaneously appointing their trade union and party donors elsewhere\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, it comes as the Government faces calls to refer the attempted takeover of The Telegraph by an Abu Dhabi fund to the CMA as a breach of legislation banning foreign state ownership of newspapers.\n\nAn investigation of the potential threat to press freedom was paused last year to allow RedBird IMI, which had acquired an option on ownership, to secure an onward sale.\n\nThe process has failed to deliver a transaction, chiefly owing to Abu Dhabi\u2019s price expectations, and RedBird IMI recently urged Telegraph executives to make job cuts and abandon editorial investments prompting a demand for action this week from Sir Ian Duncan Smith, the former Conservative leader.\n\nHe accused the Government of \u201cfoot-dragging\u201d because \u201cthey don\u2019t want to upset the UAE.\u201d\n\nA request for the CMA to complete the investigation could allow Lisa Nandy, the Culture Secretary, to order The Telegraph\u2019s independent directors to sell the company at a market price to any acceptable buyer.\n\nThe Financial Times first reported the decision to remove Mr Bokkerink. A government spokesman declined to comment. The CMA was contacted for comment.\n\nView Comments",

On one hand, the appointment of an Amazon executive to head the UK's CMA, coupled with potential pressure from a Trump administration to ease up on tech regulation, could be seen as a positive. This suggests a potentially less stringent regulatory environment for Apple in the UK, reducing the risk of investigations and restrictions on its app store practices. However, the article also mentions a potential second probe into Apple and Google's power over smartphone app stores, indicating that regulatory scrutiny is still a possibility. The overall impact is uncertain, but the potential for reduced regulatory pressure slightly outweighs the continued risk of investigation.

While the appointment of a former Amazon executive might be seen as potentially less aggressive towards tech companies, the larger context of Trump's potential trade war and ongoing investigations into Google and potentially Apple creates uncertainty.  The news doesn't directly impact Apple's financials or operations, but the threat of increased regulatory scrutiny in the UK and a broader trade war could negatively affect Apple's international market access and profitability.  The probability of a stock price rise is therefore low, while the probability of a fall is higher, although the impact is likely to be relatively small given the indirect nature of the news."

        "headline": "Meta Plans Oakley-Branded Glasses, Explores Watches and Earbuds",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Meta Platforms Inc. is working on upgrades to its popular smart glasses and is exploring new wearable devices such as watches and camera-equipped earbuds, aiming to embed its artificial intelligence features into more products.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTexas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump What LA\u2019s Fires Mean for the City\u2019s Housing Shortage Deadly Landslide of Garbage Displays Uganda's Missed Opportunity LA Schools Wrecked by Fires Plead on GoFundMe for Help to Reopen\n\nThe effort includes developing Oakley-branded smart glasses for athletes this year, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Meta\u2019s devices group, Reality Labs, also plans to release new high-end glasses with a built-in display in 2025, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the initiatives haven\u2019t been announced.\n\nOther products underway would compete with Apple Inc.\u2019s smartwatch and AirPods, the people said. And the company is making headway on its first true augmented reality product \u2014 a holy grail for the tech industry \u2014 for release around 2027. A representative for Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, declined to comment on the company\u2019s plans.\n\nThe flurry of products is part of a bid to reposition Meta as an AI innovator, with a focus on hardware that can usher in the next era of computing. The social media company has spent tens of billions on augmented and virtual reality development and launched multiple versions of headsets and glasses, but broad consumer acceptance has remained elusive.\n\nMeta currently sells Ray-Ban glasses that are embedded with cameras, microphones and other technologies. Though they stop short of being an AR device \u2014 one that superimposes data and images on real world views \u2014 the spectacles can take pictures, analyze the surrounding environment, play music and handle calls.\n\nThat product line, internally code-named \u201cSupernova,\u201d will be expanded in three major ways. First, the company is planning to introduce its current Ray-Ban glasses to new markets. Second, Meta is broadening its smart glasses technology to other fashion brands owned by partner Luxottica Group SA. That includes a new version \u2014 dubbed \u201cSupernova 2\u201d \u2014 that is based on Oakley\u2019s Sphaera glasses. This model, which shifts the camera to the center of the glasses frame, will be aimed at cyclists and other athletes.\n\nThe biggest upgrade this year will be a new higher-end offering that uses a design that\u2019s closer to the current Ray-Ban glasses. Code-named \u201cHypernova,\u201d this model will include a display on the bottom portion of the right lens that projects information into a user\u2019s field of view. People would be able to run simple software apps, view notifications and see photos taken by the device \u2014 capabilities that get a bit closer to the long-promised AR experience.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe device would carry a higher price tag. Some employees involved in the project expect the Hypernova glasses to cost around $1,000, compared with a $299 starting price for the current Meta Ray-Bans.\n\nMeta is testing an approach that lets users rely on a wrist strap \u2014 dubbed \u201cCeres\u201d \u2014 to control the glasses. The Menlo Park, California-based company has discussed offering this accessory in the same box as the Hypernova spectacles, which will also have touch controls on the frame\u2019s temple. The temple approach would be the standard input method if the wrist accessory doesn\u2019t pass muster.\n\nThe strap controller would be similar to one used by Meta\u2019s Orion prototype AR glasses, an unreleased product that the company showed off last year. The Hypernova product also may work with a smartwatch, but Meta doesn\u2019t yet offer such a device.\n\nFor about half a decade, Meta has explored releasing a smartwatch that would compete with models from Apple, Samsung Electronics Co. and others. Over the years, the company has changed the project\u2019s details and priorities, and it\u2019s canceled and uncanceled the device multiple times. Meta is now again weighing the idea of releasing a watch as early as this year \u2014 with a display that would be able to show photos taken with the company\u2019s smart glasses.\n\nFor now, Meta\u2019s glasses are essentially an accessory to users\u2019 smartphones \u2014 rather than a true replacement. But the company is moving toward more of an all-in-one product that would let consumers dispense with carrying a phone and other devices.\n\nThe Orion prototype, which relies on an external puck to handle computing, is a step toward that. The company aims to start offering that device to software developers in 2026 so they can build and test applications for it. The glasses would then be more enticing to consumers when they\u2019re released broadly.\n\nOrion itself will never be released to customers. Instead, the company looks to begin selling a follow-up version code-named \u201cArtemis\u201d as early as 2027. Meta still needs to overcome challenges relating to costs, display technology and manufacturing before actually shipping it.\n\nBut people with knowledge of Artemis prototypes say they\u2019re more advanced than the Orion test units and aren\u2019t as heavy. Weight has been a stumbling block for other headset devices, including Apple\u2019s Vision Pro.\n\nMeta also is creating prototypes of an AirPods rival with built-in cameras that can see the outside world and take action using AI. If Meta decides to produce the earbuds for consumers, they likely wouldn\u2019t hit the market for a couple of years.\n\nSuch a device would let users look at an object and ask the earbuds to analyze the item. The features would be similar to what Meta already offers with the Ray-Ban smart glasses, but in a product form that\u2019s already popular with consumers.\n\nBut here too there have been snags. It\u2019s harder for people with long hair to use the device, for example. Meta also remains unsatisfied with the angle of the cameras in recent demo versions. Work on the earbuds, called \u201cCamera Buds\u201d internally, remains early, the people said. And it\u2019s always possible that the company cancels the project if it can\u2019t resolve the challenges.\n\nApple also is exploring the idea of putting cameras on earbuds and has made progress over the past few months, Bloomberg News has reported. Samsung, which sells earbuds that are similar to Apple\u2019s AirPods, is considering a version with cameras as well, according to other people with knowledge of the matter.\n\n--With assistance from Riley Griffin.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nWalgreens Replaced Fridge Doors With Smart Screens.

The second great factor that may attract investment is the production of the new iPhone SE model, which is being prepared for an early 2025 launch that will include artificial intelligence (AI) features. Moreover, the company has collaborated with OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT technology into its devices, which will enhance app personalization and user experience. Lastly, the integration of Apple Intelligence into a broader range of devices, including the iPhone SE 4, iPad, Apple Watch, and Apple TV, also holds great investment potential.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of the stocks Billionaire Chen Tianqiao dumped and bet on. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

                "reasoning": "The news highlights both positive and negative aspects regarding Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, AAPL has shown financial growth with a revenue increase and is launching new products with AI features, which could attract investor interest. However, the mention of billionaire Chen Tianqiao dumping some tech stocks, including AAPL, may raise concerns among investors about the stock's future performance. Overall, the positive developments in AI integration and product launches suggest a higher likelihood of stock price increase, but the negative sentiment from the billionaire's actions introduces some uncertainty."

                "reasoning": "The news article presents a mixed picture for Apple (AAPL). On one hand, it highlights that a prominent investor, Chen Tianqiao, holds a significant stake in Apple ($116.5 million). This suggests confidence in the company. The article also mentions positive factors like revenue growth, dividend payouts, and upcoming AI-integrated products (iPhone SE 4 with AI features, ChatGPT integration, Apple Intelligence). These are all potentially positive catalysts for the stock. However, the article also states that AAPL ranks 3rd on a list of stocks Chen Tianqiao \"dumped and bet on,\" implying he may have reduced his position or is less bullish on AAPL compared to other stocks. The article explicitly states that the author believes other stocks hold greater promise for higher returns in a shorter timeframe. This negative sentiment, combined with the ambiguity of the \"dumped and bet on\" phrasing, creates uncertainty. Given the mixed signals, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price rise due to the existing stake and positive developments, but acknowledging the potential for a fall due to the relative lack of conviction compared to other stocks in Chen's portfolio and the author's negative sentiment."

                "reasoning": "The news article discusses billionaire Chen Tianqiao's investment portfolio, revealing a $116.5 million stake in Apple (AAPL). While the article highlights Apple's positive financial performance, AI integrations, and new product launches, it ultimately ranks AAPL as only the 3rd most promising investment in Tianqiao's portfolio.  The article's emphasis on other stocks with potentially higher returns suggests that Tianqiao's investment in AAPL might not be a strong endorsement of the stock's immediate future performance.  The article's overall tone is neutral to slightly negative regarding AAPL's short-term prospects compared to other investments. Therefore, the probability of a price rise is considered lower than the probability of a price remaining relatively stable or experiencing a slight decline, given the context of the article."

While the article mentions that Chen Tianqiao's hedge fund, Shanda Asset Management, has a stake in AAPL, it does not explicitly state whether he has increased or decreased his position. The article highlights several positive aspects of Apple, including strong financial growth, new product launches with AI features, and collaborations with OpenAI. These factors are likely to be viewed positively by investors. However, the headline suggests uncertainty ('Dumped or Bet on?'), which could introduce some volatility.

        "content": "Shares of Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) fell 4.1% on Tuesday, as of 12:30 p.m ET.\n\nApple was downgraded by not one but two Wall Street sell-side analysts, as preliminary figures for the December quarter suggest disappointing iPhone sales.\n\nJefferies and Loop take Apple down a notch\n\nToday, analysts at Jefferies and Loop Capital each downgraded their ratings on Apple.\n\nJefferies analyst Edison Lee downgraded Apple from hold to underperform and lowered his price target from $211.84 to $200.75. Referencing International Data Corporation (IDC) data, Lee recalibrated iPhone shipment figures from 1% growth to a 2% decline in the December quarter. But even that may be optimistic, as IDC data indicates the potential for a 4% decline in iPhone shipments.\n\nThe main source of weakness is China, unsurprisingly, where independent research suggests an 18.2% decline in iPhone sales. The Chinese consumer is in a sort of recession at the moment, and low-priced domestic rivals appear to be taking share.\n\nLee also noted consumers don't appear to see a huge benefit from Apple Intelligence as of yet. As such, the anticipated AI-fueled upgrade cycle may not materialize as some think.\n\nLoop also downgraded Apple from buy to hold today, citing weak current trends and the potential for bad forward guidance for the March quarter. Loop remains a bit more optimistic than Jefferies, as it still anticipates a \"material amplifying\" of demand in the June and September quarters later this year. Loop still believes in Apple's \"structural\" long-term growth as an AI beneficiary, but the timing appears delayed.\n\nCan Apple figure out AI?\n\nAt over 36 times earnings, Apple appears expensive for a company that only grows in the single digits. Apple also has complications with China from a demand perspective and the fact that it manufactures iPhones there. Furthermore, it's an open question as to whether Apple can execute on AI.\n\nApple still has a huge, sticky customer base, so it doesn't appear there is any grave danger. But its valuation doesn't leave much room for disappointment at these levels.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Loop Capital also downgraded Apple's stock from Buy to Hold, with a revised price target of $230, down from $275.\n\nIn an investor note, Lee said he expects Apple to report lower-than-expected results for its December quarter and a miss on expectations for the second quarter on weak iPhone sales and a lack of interest in AI among consumers.\n\nShares of Apple fell as much as 3.7% midday on Tuesday. The stock is up 16% over the last 12 months. Big Tech rivals Meta (META) and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) are up some 36% and 30%, respectively, over the last year, while Microsoft (MSFT) is up just 3.5%. The broader S&P 500 has climbed 20% in the same period.\n\nAccording to Lee, iPhone sales in China fell between 15% and 20% year over year. Apple is contending with a number of headwinds in the region, including the continued ascendence of local offerings from Huawei and Xiaomi and cautious consumer spending amidst a slower economic backdrop.\n\nApple isn\u2019t just dealing with trouble in China.

Apple Intelligence, Apple\u2019s artificial intelligence platform for the iPhone, iPad, and Mac, was expected to kick off a sales supercycle.

It\u2019s a risky move for Apple, which generally debuts its latest and greatest products and services at one time via big, splashy launch events. That makes it difficult for customers to know when the platform will feature all of the capabilities Apple initially promised when it debuted Apple Intelligence in June 2024.\n\nAI smartphones and their counterpart AI PCs are struggling to gain traction despite a massive sales push from tech giants ranging from Apple and Google to Microsoft and Intel.\n\nApple\u2019s iPhone is its most important product, and China is among its most important sales regions. In 2024, the iPhone accounted for $201.1 billion of Apple\u2019s $391 billion in total revenue. The company\u2019s second-largest business segment, its Services division, brought in $96.1 billion.\n\nStory Continues\n\nChina, however, has proven to be a persistent area of trouble for Apple over the last two years. Sales in the region declined 8% in 2024, falling to $66.9 billion, and 2% in 2023. At the time, Apple blamed weakness in the renminbi versus the dollar and lower iPhone and iPad sales.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman, Apple will debut a new iPhone SE in the coming months, which could help goose overall sales in the mid-range smartphone market.

The downgrades and reduced price targets suggest a negative outlook for the company's stock. Additionally, the article mentions that iPhone sales in China fell between 15% and 20% year over year, and overall iPhone market share fell roughly 1% year over year in Q4. These factors contribute to a higher probability of the stock price falling. However, the article also mentions that Apple is set to debut new products, such as a new iPhone SE, entry-level iPads, and new MacBook Airs, which could potentially drive improved sales. Despite this, the overall tone of the article is bearish, leading to a higher estimated probability of the stock price falling."

        "content": "Apple (AAPL, Financial) shares tumbled more than 4% on Tuesday after analysts across the board downgraded the stock, citing mounting worries about sagging iPhone sales and lackluster performance in hardware and services.\n\nApple was downgraded to underperform from hold by Jefferies analyst Edison Lee, who cut his price target to $200.75 from $211.84. However, Lee said the downgrade reflected weakening demand for the iPhone, particularly in major foreign markets such as China. However, efforts to boost sales with new models, such as the budget-friendly iPhone SE, have not really gotten buy-in in an increasingly crowded smartphone market, which has raised doubts about revenue growth.\n\nLast week, Barclays also downgraded Apple to an underweight from an equal weight rating, warning of poor iPhone 15 sales and anticipating more of the same with the iPhone 16. It also long condemned Apple's product lineup as not innovative enough, which, he said, had dulled consumer interest and buying momentum.\n\nApple's hardware business, of course, extends beyond smartphones, and it also has headwinds. Declining sales of MacBooks and iPads were also a long pointer to bigger problems in the company's hardware arm, a historically lucrative revenue generator.\n\nGrowing skepticism of Apple's ability to keep its growth well intact in the face of changing market conditions led to these downgrades. Meanwhile, analysts remain wary of Apple's near-term performance as it grapples with intensifying competition and economic pressures, a selling factor in recent weakness.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

Meanwhile, two banks have downgraded the iPhone maker's shares recently.\n\nApple May Be Facing Major Problems in China\n\nThe number of iPhones handed over in China dove 18% in Q4 versus the same period a year earlier, according to Counterpoint Research. As a consequence, China-based Huawei Technologies Co. took over the top spot in the Asian country from AAPL, and the American firm's market share has fallen to about one-sixth. Additionally, AAPL is now number three when it comes to smartphone sales in China.Apple Inc (AAPL): AI Innovations Shaping the Future\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nTwo Banks Cut Their Ratings on AAPL\n\nInvestment bank Jefferies downgraded the firm to Underperform. The investment bank believes that AAPL has sold fewer iPhones than expected. Moreover, a survey found that American consumers do not believe that the company's AI is \"useful,\" Jefferies reported. As a result, the technology probably won't trigger a supercycle, the investment bank predicted, adding that the company's results for its March quarter may make the Street unhappy.\n\nMeanwhile, Loop Capital downgraded AAPL to Hold. It predicts that the demand for Apple's iPhones will drop significantly during the current quarter before sinking much further over the subsequent six months.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of AAPL, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Jefferies, a reputable firm, has downgraded Apple's rating to Underperform, citing concerns about slowing iPhone demand, weaker-than-expected revenue growth, delays in AI adoption, and competitive pressures.  The lowered price target of $200.75 is significantly below the current trading price of $221.25.  The negative market reaction (a 3.8% drop) further supports the bearish sentiment. While Apple's Q1 earnings report could potentially offer a positive surprise, the current news strongly suggests a higher probability of a price fall. The factors mentioned, such as reduced iPhone shipments, competition from cheaper alternatives, and potential limitations in China, all point towards a continued downward trend in the short term.  Therefore, the probability of a price fall is significantly higher than a price rise."

        "content": "Why Apple (AAPL) Shares Are Trading Lower Today\n\nWhat Happened?\n\nShares of iPhone and iPad maker Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) fell 4.1% in the morning session after Jefferies analyst Edison Lee downgraded the stock's rating from Hold to Sell, and echoed concerns about weak iPhone sales. Lee expects AAPL to report Q1'2025 revenue below consensus estimates when it officially reports earnings later in the month. Similarly, Loop Capital downgraded shares of the iPhone maker from Buy to Hold, adding \"Downgrading to Hold With Material Demand Reductions Ahead of iPhone 17.\" Overall, the weak sentiment highlights growing concerns about Apple's sales strength and dominance in the smartphone market.\n\nThe shares closed the day at $222.66, down 3.2% from previous close.\n\nThe stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Apple? Access our full analysis report here, it\u2019s free.\n\nWhat The Market Is Telling Us\n\nApple\u2019s shares are quite volatile and have had 17 moves greater than 2.5% over the last year. In that context, today\u2019s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 5 days ago when the stock dropped 3.2% on the news that data from research firm Canalys revealed the company (AAPL) is losing dominance in China. The data revealed that iPhone shipments in China fell 17% to 42.9 million units in 2024, pushing Apple down to third place in market share. The decline was partly blamed on the lack of artificial intelligence features in new iPhones. This weak print is significant for Apple since China accounted for roughly 17% of its total sales in fiscal year 2024.\n\nApple is down 8.8% since the beginning of the year, and at $222.32 per share, it is trading 14.2% below its 52-week high of $259.02 from December 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Apple\u2019s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $2,809.\n\nToday\u2019s young investors likely haven\u2019t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next.\n\nView Comments",

However, the market's reaction to Pelosi's trades is often unpredictable and can be influenced by broader market trends and investor sentiment. The fact that she is buying other tech stocks could also be interpreted as a sector rotation rather than a negative view on Apple specifically.

Her selling could be due to various reasons unrelated to her outlook on Apple's future performance, such as portfolio rebalancing, tax implications, or personal financial needs.  The fact that this is a single data point, and not a broader trend of insider selling, reduces its predictive power.  The news itself is unlikely to significantly impact Apple's stock price, given Apple's size and established market position.

        "headline": "Warren Buffett Sold This Stock, but I Think He's Completely Wrong",
        "content": "Heading into 2023, Warren Buffett-led Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) had a substantial investment in General Motors(NYSE: GM). According to Berkshire's SEC filings, the conglomerate owned 50 million shares of GM at the beginning of that year, worth about $1.7 billion at the time.\n\nThroughout 2023, Buffett unloaded all of Berkshire's General Motors stock. However, I think he made the wrong decision. Not only is General Motors up by more than 55% since the end of the quarter when Berkshire sold, but the company is also doing a great job of maximizing profits and creating shareholder value.\n\nLots to like about this \"legacy\" automaker\n\nEven though Buffett sold GM, there's quite a bit to like about the stock right now.\n\nFor one thing, the business has been surprisingly resilient, given the combination of higher interest rates and more cautious consumer spending. In the company's third-quarter 2024 earnings, the latest reported, GM surprised investors with both top- and bottom-line results that handily surpassed expectations, as well as an increase in its full-year earnings guidance.\n\nThen, at its October 2024 investor day, management surprised the market, which expected a slowdown, by saying that its 2025 adjusted earnings will be in a \"similar range\" to 2024.\n\nOther recent news has been quite encouraging as well. GM reported that its 2024 sales increased by 4% and that its market share increased overall and doubled in the case of electric vehicles. Deliveries in China increased by 40.6% sequentially in the fourth quarter.\n\nAnother recent development is that GM will pivot its Cruise autonomous strategy away from developing robotaxis and toward developing its Super Cruise autonomous technology for personal vehicles. This move alone is expected to save the company more than $1 billion annually.\n\nGM is also aggressively using excess capital to buy back shares. Since late 2023, when GM announced an accelerated buyback program, the company's outstanding share count has declined by 21%, and there could be more buybacks ahead, especially considering the stronger-than-expected 2025 outlook and the fact that it hopefully won't be sinking as much money into automation. It's also worth noting that since the buyback was announced, GM's stock is up by more than 40%.\n\nIt's not too surprising that GM is being so aggressive with buybacks. The stock trades for just 5.5 times trailing-12-month earnings and 5.1 times forward earnings. If GM can achieve its 2025 targets and execute well on its growth plans, the stock could be a tremendous bargain.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhy did Buffett sell?\n\nBuffett hasn't specified his reasons for selling General Motors. But it's worth noting that he has been a net seller of stocks for the past couple of years and has aggressively reduced some of Berkshire's largest investments, including the massive stakes in Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) and Bank of America(NYSE: BAC).\n\nMy instinct is that he sold because of some of the perceived risk factors with the stock. At the time of the sales, many experts were forecasting new auto demand to fall more than it actually did, and in the fall of 2023, there was a strike by auto workers that cost GM an estimated $800 million.\n\nWhatever the reasons Buffett had for selling might be, I think he's wrong, and I don't often say that about Buffett's moves. GM is doing a fantastic job of keeping its sales and profit high, and I think this could be one of the biggest bargains in the stock market right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in General Motors right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in General Motors, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and General Motors wasn\u2019t one of them.

The article argues that GM is resilient despite economic challenges and is effectively maximizing profits, which could indicate a positive outlook for the company. However, the focus is on GM rather than Apple Inc. (AAPL), and there is no direct negative news about AAPL. Given that Buffett has reduced his stake in AAPL, there may be some concern among investors, but the overall sentiment in the news does not suggest a significant negative impact on AAPL's stock price. Therefore, the probability of AAPL's stock price rising remains higher than falling, but with some caution due to Buffett's actions."

While the article mentions Apple (AAPL) in the context of Buffett reducing his stake in it, the core argument and supporting data revolve around GM's performance and future prospects. Therefore, the primary impact of this news will be on GM, not Apple. The article presents a bullish case for GM, citing strong earnings, positive sales data, a strategic shift in autonomous vehicle development, and aggressive share buybacks. The analyst believes GM is undervalued. However, the article also mentions that Buffett sold GM due to perceived risks, and The Motley Fool's Stock Advisor doesn't recommend GM as one of their top picks. This creates a mixed signal. Since the article is primarily about GM, the impact on Apple is minimal. The mention of Buffett reducing his Apple stake is a known fact and doesn't provide new information that would significantly move Apple's stock price. Therefore, the probabilities for Apple's stock price movement are close to neutral."

While the article mentions Buffett's reduction of his Apple holdings, it doesn't provide any new information about Apple's performance or prospects. The article's analysis of GM's positive performance is irrelevant to Apple's stock price. Therefore, the news is unlikely to significantly impact Apple's stock price.

Given the lack of direct relevance to Apple, the news is unlikely to cause significant movement in Apple's stock price. However, as Buffett's actions can influence market sentiment, the mention of his selling activities might contribute to a slightly negative perception of Apple stock.

        "headline": "Should You Buy Apple Stock Before Jan. 30?",
        "content": "Jan. 30 will be a massive day for Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) stock, as that's when the company reports results for the first quarter of its fiscal year 2025 (ending around Dec. 31). This is a huge deal, as it includes the all-important holiday quarter, which could make or break Apple's stock.\n\nApple needs to change the narrative around its stock, as the company has delivered fairly stagnant growth over the past few years. The news could mark a huge shift in sentiment for Apple stock, and it needs a strong report to maintain the status quo.\n\nApple needs to kickstart its revenue growth this year\n\nApple is one of the most recognizable consumer electronics brands around the globe. It has built a powerhouse on an ecosystem that connects flawlessly with each other devices and successfully captured the most important audience for any company: young consumers.\n\nThis drove significant growth for many years, but since 2022, its revenue hasn't really grown.AAPL Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts\n\nThat's years of stagnant revenue, which isn't a great sign for a business. However, Apple is one of the best companies in the world, so that hasn't stopped it from growing its earnings through a combination of share buybacks and improving profitability. Still, there is only so much juice to squeeze when making a company more efficient, and Apple may be nearing its limit.AAPL Operating Margin (Quarterly) data by YCharts\n\nThis leaves share buybacks as the primary way to grow earnings, but the effect of these repurchases may start to diminish. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended Sept. 28), Apple spent $25 billion on buybacks. But that occurred during a time when Apple was valued at near its highest point in five years.AAPL PE Ratio data by YCharts\n\nThis makes the share repurchases less effective because the company has to pay a higher price to repurchase its own stock. This reduces the program's effect on earnings-per-share (EPS) growth.\n\nSo, with two of Apple's primary ways to grow earnings potentially running out of steam, the conversation circles back to revenue growth, which Apple has struggled with over the past few years.\n\nExpectations for Q1 aren't high\n\nFiscal Q1 encompasses the holiday quarter, and it will be a key moment for Apple to see if its iPhones and Apple Intelligence made a difference for consumers. Apple is seeing rising competition from Android phone makers, and this may weigh on Apple's results.\n\nWall Street analysts aren't expecting a lot from Apple in Q1, as they project 3.9% sales growth and 7.8% EPS growth. Investors may be highly critical of Apple even if it posts results that everyone expects.\n\nStory Continues\n\nSo, should investors buy Apple stock before Jan. 30? I'd say no.\n\nThere isn't much optimism about Apple's business right now, and even if it reports a blowout quarter, the expectations are so high that Apple's stock likely won't budge. It trades for 32 times forward earnings right now, which is normally a level reserved for a company growing earnings and revenue at least in the mid-teens range.\n\nApple isn't anywhere close to that, so there's a lot of risk and not a ton of reward left in the stock. There are many cheaper alternatives with better growth than Apple, and investors should invest their money in those before buying Apple shares.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Analyst expectations are already low, suggesting limited upside even if Apple meets those expectations.

The article highlights concerns about stagnant revenue growth, diminishing returns from share buybacks, and increasing competition.  The author's prediction of 'no' to the question of buying before Jan 30th strongly suggests a belief in a higher probability of a price fall or stagnation. The mention of cheaper alternatives with better growth further reinforces this negative sentiment.  The inclusion of past successful investments is likely a marketing tactic unrelated to the Apple stock prediction itself."

        "headline": "3 Warren Buffett Stocks With Up to 50% Upside in 2025, According to Select Wall Street Analysts",
        "content": "In 1973, Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) held its first annual shareholder meeting in the cafeteria of one of its subsidiaries and drew a few dozen people. Roughly 50 years later, around 40,000 people make the pilgrimage to Omaha each year. This is the Warren Buffett effect in action.\n\nSince taking over as Berkshire's CEO six decades ago, the Oracle of Omaha has led his company's Class A shares (BRK.A) to an aggregate gain of more than 5,681,000%, as of the closing bell on Jan. 17. This is far and away better than the total return of the benchmark S&P 500 over the same timeline, and it's earned Buffett quite the following among professional and everyday investors.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nToday, Buffett oversees a 44-stock, $297 billion portfolio at Berkshire Hathaway. However, the outlook for these 44 stocks can differ greatly.\n\nBased on the 12-month price targets issued by select Wall Street analysts, three Buffett stocks can return up to 50% for their shareholders in 2025.\n\nSirius XM Holdings: Implied upside of 44% in 2025\n\nThe first Warren Buffett stock that can deliver significant upside, based on the prognostication of one Wall Street analyst, is satellite-radio operator Sirius XM Holdings(NASDAQ: SIRI). According to Benchmark's Matthew Harrigan, Sirius XM stock can reach $32 per share, which would represent upside of 44% from where shares closed last week.\n\nOn one hand, Sirius XM has been contending with undeniable headwinds. Despite being the only licensed satellite-radio operator, it's still competing for listeners with online and terrestrial radio companies. Further, vehicle sales have been mostly stagnant over the last two years, which is a concern given that Sirius XM counts on transitioning promotional subscriptions with new vehicle purchases to self-pay subscribers.\n\nIn spite of these headwinds, there are reasons to believe a $32 price target is within reach. As noted, the company is a legal monopoly, which does afford it some degree of subscription pricing power that other radio operators and online streaming services may lack.\n\nThe more important differentiating factor for Sirius XM has always been how it generates its revenue. While most traditional radio companies rely almost exclusively on advertising to keep the lights on, Sirius XM brought in close to 77% of its net sales through the first nine months of 2024 from subscriptions and only around 20% from advertising. Whereas businesses can quickly pare back ad spending during periods of economic instability, subscribers are far less likely to cancel their service. In short, it makes Sirius XM's operating cash flow more consistent and predictable.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThere's an intriguing value proposition, as well. Amid one of the priciest stock markets in history, Sirius XM stock can be scooped up for just over 7 times forward-year earnings. If management can keep a lid on spending and lean on its monopoly driven subscription pricing power, it should bode well for Sirius XM's shareholders.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nOccidental Petroleum: Implied upside of 50% in 2025\n\nA second Warren Buffett stock with plenty of upside potential in 2025 is a company the Oracle of Omaha has been buying hand over fist for three consecutive years: integrated oil and gas giant Occidental Petroleum(NYSE: OXY). Analyst John Freeman at Raymond James foresees Occidental stock gushing to $78 per share, which would signal a gain of 50% in the new year.\n\nAlthough the spot price of crude oil is important for all integrated energy companies, it takes on added meaning for Occidental Petroleum. Despite having midstream transmission pipelines and downstream chemical operations, the lion's share of Occidental's revenue can be traced to its drilling operations. If the spot price of crude oil rises, Occidental's benefits more than its peers.\n\nThe thing to keep in mind about Occidental Petroleum is that the opposite scenario is also true. If the price for oil declines, few if any integrated energy companies is likely to be hit harder.\n\nThankfully, there are catalysts that can buoy the spot price of oil. Russia's invasion of Ukraine nearly three years ago has created energy demand uncertainties in Europe. Meanwhile, Donald Trump's November victory and the expected implementation of tariffs paves the way for geopolitical tension that could drive the price of oil higher.\n\nPerhaps the biggest wildcard for Occidental Petroleum in 2025 is the company's balance sheet. Although it made some headway in reducing its debt following its acquisition of Anadarko in 2019, Occidental is still lugging around $25.5 billion in net debt, as of Sept. 30, 2024. Though Buffett generally avoids businesses constrained by a lot of debt, Occidental appears to be the exception.\n\nApple: Implied upside of 41% in 2025\n\nThe third Warren Buffett stock that at least one Wall Street analyst believes can soar in 2025 is none other than Berkshire Hathaway's largest holding, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). Less than a month ago, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives lifted his price target on Apple to $325 per share, which implies upside of 41% in the new year.\n\nIves's excitement has to do with Apple's integration of artificial intelligence (AI) solutions into its products. The ongoing incorporation of Apple Intelligence (Apple's AI operating model) into its physical devices via software updates is expected to boost consumer demand for the company's products and enhance brand loyalty.\n\nIn addition to revamping its physical products lineup with Apple Intelligence, the company's continued transformation as a services provider has taken off. Apple's Services segment, which is fueled by subscriptions, keeps its customers loyal to its umbrella of products and services, and should help to smooth out the revenue fluctuations that typically accompany major iPhone upgrade cycles.\n\nI'd be remiss if I didn't also point out the value Apple's world-leading capital-return program has provided. Since the start of 2013, it's repurchased more than $725 billion worth of its common stock and reduced its outstanding share count by almost 43%. Companies with steady or growing net income and a declining share count will typically see their earnings per share (EPS) climb and be viewed more favorably by investors.\n\nHowever, Apple stock is historically pricey, relative to its trailing-12-month EPS. Between Oct. 1, 2023, and Sept. 30, 2024, Buffett oversaw the sale of 67% of Berkshire Hathaway's stake in Apple. Even though the Oracle of Omaha loves the Apple brand, its management team, and its capital-return program, he's first-and-foremost a value investor -- and \"value\" is a term that would be a stretch to describe Apple at the moment.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

The integration of AI into Apple's products and the growth of its services segment are strong catalysts for future growth. However, the mention of Warren Buffett reducing his stake in Apple raises some concerns about its valuation. Overall, the positive analyst sentiment and growth prospects outweigh the concerns, leading to a higher probability of stock price rise."

The article highlights a 41% upside potential according to Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, driven by AI integration (Apple Intelligence) and the growth of Apple's services segment. However, the article also mentions that Buffett has been selling off a significant portion of Berkshire Hathaway's Apple stake due to valuation concerns. This creates a mixed signal. The positive analyst outlook and AI integration are bullish factors, while Buffett's selling and valuation concerns are bearish. Considering these factors, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a price rise than a fall, but not overwhelmingly so, as the valuation concerns are significant."

However, the article also notes that Warren Buffett, a renowned value investor, recently significantly reduced Berkshire Hathaway's stake in Apple, suggesting a potential overvaluation concern.  While the AI integration and services growth are positive factors, the counterpoint of Buffett's actions and Apple's historically high price-to-earnings ratio introduces uncertainty.  Therefore, the probability of a price rise is considered moderate, acknowledging both the bullish prediction and the potential for a correction."

It doesn't provide any specific information about Apple's financial performance, future prospects, or any significant events.  Such headlines often appear when analysts are questioning the company's continued dominance in the market, possibly due to increased competition or slowing growth.  However, without concrete details, it's impossible to definitively predict stock price movement.  Therefore, the probabilities are assigned based on the inherent uncertainty of the news itself.  A neutral stance is taken, assuming the market will react based on other factors rather than this ambiguous headline."

The headline does not provide any direct information that would cause a significant positive or negative impact on the stock price. It seems to be more of a questioning or analytical piece rather than a news piece with specific data or events that would drive the stock price up or down. Therefore, based on this headline alone, the probability of the stock price rising or falling significantly is relatively low. However, since the question is about market leadership, which is a positive attribute, there might be a slight bias towards maintaining or increasing the stock price if the market interprets it as still being a leader."

It appears to be a question rather than a statement, which suggests that the article may be exploring the company's position in the market without taking a clear stance. Given the lack of concrete information, the impact on the stock price is likely to be minimal. However, since Apple is generally considered a stable and leading company in its sector, any neutral or non-negative news might slightly lean towards a positive interpretation by investors, potentially leading to a slight increase in stock price. Nonetheless, the effect is expected to be small due to the neutral nature of the headline."

        "headline": "Jim Cramer on Apple Inc. (AAPL): \u2018Apple Wildcard To The Downside. It\u2019s Kind Of A Two Of Clubs\u2019",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Recently Discussed These 17 Stocks And Chinese Hackers.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.\n\nJim Cramer's appearance on Squawk on the Street aired on January 17th covered a wide variety of topics. As the day was in the final few days of the outgoing Biden administration, Cramer shared his thoughts about the policies of the outgoing and incoming governments. Commenting on President-elect Trump's nominee for Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent's confirmation hearing Cramer shared that he \"liked it.\" He shared the reasons behind his approval.\n\n\"Well, I think that, in the end, he respects the process. I think a lot of the, I think there's the process respecters and the process undoers,\" Cramer thinks. He \"felt that Secretary Bessent, soon to be, I gotta be careful, who knows, he's talking about, there was a give and take. There was a moment when he was give and take with Senator Sanders.\" While during their exchange, Cramer thought \"Sanders thought that he was gonna, tee off on Sanders.\" However, Bessent and Sanders actually \"had common ground, and there was a lot of respect. And then I think Sanders had nothing to say, it was kind of like, okay,\" according to the CNBC host.\n\nAnother hot topic in the markets is the President-elect's potential policies on cryptocurrency. When asked by co-host Sara Eisen about his thoughts on Trump passing an executive order for crypto, Cramer stated \"I agree and I think, well look the President-elect has made it no secret that he wants a strategic crypto reserve. So I'm not quite sure where that would be. Not in Fort Knox, it's kind of, anywhere, right. I would like to make sure the blockchain is severe. I'm trying really hard to get a grip on that reserve because it doesn't jump out at me.\"\n\nOne country that Cramer regularly targets in his morning thoughts is China. This time around, he likened China to East Germany. \" We thought East Germany was incredibly powerful. They would go to the Olympics, and we'd say they're amazing. We thought their schools were really great. And it turned out to be an empty suit,\" believes Cramer. China needs \"exports, they need everybody, they need help from everyone and they don't wanna help anyone,\" according to him.\n\nIn fact, China might be one of the reasons \"President-elect Trump was elected,\" he shared. Cramer shared that this is \"because the Chinese dumped everything in every, of what we used to make. I mean my father sold gift wrap. They wiped out the gift wrap companies. So my father ended up working for the Chinese. They were nice to him.\" China's hostility leads Cramer to \"think that we all should be cognizant that the Chinese are not our friends. But they are trying. I think that's smart to try.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe CNBC host also shared his on a recent conversation between China's President Xi Jinping and the President-elect. \"Well look I think that Taiwan is a hot button. Because President-elect Trump has said why doesn't Taiwan pay more for its defense? I get that. That's a kind of the NATO, consistent, right, consistent with NATO,\" he shared. Cramer also shared his thoughts on Bessent saying tariffs are not inflationary. According to him, \"Well, I liked that even though everything we've ever read all our lives says that they're inflationary.\"\n\nHe still likes Bessent since Cramer believes \"Bessent's a serious guy. I mean when you sit down and you watch these presentations and interactions in the European world where they interview him. The man is so thoughtful. That you're close to Secretary Yellen, I think that in terms of a chess match, I'll bet Bessent. He's really exciting. He's an exciting intellect.\" In fact, Cramer thinks that Bessent \"may know more about the way the economy interacts with our country than anyone out there.\"\n\nFinally, the outgoing Biden administration, particularly the Treasury Department, has been repeatedly targeted by Chinese hackers. Cramer quoted a cybersecurity CEO and shared:\n\n\"He was describing how out of date most of our government is in terms of identity. Meaning that you can, someone's hacking you, you're blocked, because they don't have the eye, like you know it's vision, or it's finger. And we don't do that. We use very old fashioned technology from the nineties where it's very easy to hack. Everyone in the world knows the last four digits of your social security number.. . .we need to have visual, or we need to have fingerprint, and we don't. Which is crazy.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired on January 17th.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Apple Inc (AAPL): AI Innovations Shaping the Future\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the most valuable consumer electronics firm in the world. It has been a regular feature in Cramer's recent shows. The CNBC host believes that the iPhone's sales play an unnecessarily large role in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s hypothesis. The stock is vulnerable to any reports of an iPhone downturn as the smartphone accounts for more than half of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s revenue. Cramer has also dismissed Mark Zuckerberg's criticism of innovation ending at the firm since Steve Jobs' death. This time around, he commented on the impact of the Chinese economy on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL):\n\n\"Well I mean look, people are trying to justify like Evercore comes out and says listen we got the stronger for longer iPhone cycle. Uh, yeah that's true but the decline I think had a lot to do with the fact that the stock had this spurt, at the end of the year that seemed really. I mean what was that about? I mean NVIDIA had somewhat of a similar one and both stocks have just been laggards since the year began. And it's just a lot of controversy, a lot of belief that the stocks have gotten overvalued. I say, own them, don't trade them. But, I don't think Apple's going to have a good quarter. Who does think Apple's going to have a good quarter? I mean that's the thing when you read these pieces of research, Sarah, they're all saying you know what Apple could surprise to the downside. Well, if everyone says that Apple's going to surprise to the downside then what kind of surprise is it? It's a surprising non-surprise.\"\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "headline": "3 Subtle Investing Mistakes I Won't Repeat in 2025 And Beyond",
        "content": "It's normal to make more than a few flubs while investing, especially when you're new. At the same time, we owe it to ourselves to be humble and to recognize when we've made a mistake with our finances. There's no point in beating yourself up, but there's a big point to understanding what went wrong and how to do it better the next time -- after all, there's money on the line.\n\nNot every mistake has to be a catastrophe, obviously. But it's still worth ironing out the kinks in your investing habits, especially if you plan to be investing for decades to come. With that in mind, I'd like to share three examples of less-serious oversights I made in 2024 so that you can (hopefully) avoid them in your own investing life.\n\n1. Not updating my investment thesis in a timely fashion\n\nOne of my rules is that I need to have a strong and pithy investment thesis for every investment I make, and for any that I write about, too. But an investment thesis simply can't be a monolith that stands unchanged over time, as markets are constantly changing, and businesses are constantly updating their strategies to compete more effectively both today and in the future.\n\nThe more complicated the industry and the more complicated the company, the more moving parts there are for the investor to take into account when formulating a thesis, which entails a larger responsibility to update the thesis more frequently. Even when broadly upholding that responsibility, it's still very possible to miss the forest for the trees, as I did with Pfizer (NYSE: PFE).\n\nSince roughly 2020, my investment thesis called for Pfizer to be a favorable stock to buy and hold because of its large portfolio of pharmaceuticals and its demonstrated competency in research and development (R&D), as reflected by its massive pipeline.\n\nNonetheless, the stock is down by 45% over the last three years, badly underperforming the market's gain of 31%. Clearly, something wasn't working, but I kept circling back to the same factors that were originally in my investment thesis, finding them to still be sound.\n\nThen, late in 2024, an activist investing group called Starboard Value said that it had taken a $1 billion stake in Pfizer with the goal of improving the company's efficiency. The group published a report outlining many areas where it thought that the company was struggling, including specifically its R&D efficiency and its capital allocation strategy.\n\nReading the report, I was gobsmacked; the activist group had essentially explained to me quite fastidiously that my investment thesis was no longer accurate. I immediately changed my stance on the stock to be a bit more bearish.\n\nStory Continues\n\nOne lesson here is to listen to any nagging feelings you have about a stock and its performance. If your investment thesis still seems true on the surface in the face of a company's difficulties, dig deeper into the details, and be ready to update your mental model accordingly.\n\n2. Assuming the best outcome would occur\n\nAnother subtle investing mistake I made pertains to Costco Wholesale, (NASDAQ: COST), which to this day remains my single most favorite investment.\n\nIn late 2023, Costco's CEO announced he would be retiring, and that he would be replaced in the following year by Ron Vachris, who was the company's president at the time and an employee for 40 years. Given Costco's tradition of successfully promoting leaders from within, I reacted positively to the news and thought nothing more it.\n\nBut that was a mistake, even if it didn't carry negative consequences. My level of trust in the board of directors was and still is fairly high. Nothing has gone wrong with Costco under its new management. I'll buy more shares as I'm able to do so.\n\nStill, if you don't perform any due diligence when you know there has been a major change with one of your investments, like a new CEO, it's much harder to build the conviction necessary to hold on to your shares for the longer periods of time, where you'll see the largest growth.\n\nThink about it. Psychologically, it's much better to have a hunch about which new factor is causing things to go right -- or wrong -- than it is to look at your returns and feel confused about what's happening. Checking the details is how to become a better investor.\n\n3. Complacency\n\nI've held Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) for quite some time now. Everyone knows that Apple will be selling iPhones, MacBooks, and iCloud subscriptions until the end of time, not to mention a bunch of other products and services. Its brand is most likely the most valuable on the planet, and it has an endless runway for more growth.\n\nBut does the company's actual performance bear out all of this common \"knowledge\" that formed the basis for my investment in the stock? In a word, no. Over the last 10 years, its quarterly revenue has risen by 63.6%, reaching $94.9 billion, and its free cash flow (FCF) has grown by 43.9%, reaching $23.9 billion.\n\nThose figures are impressive for a gargantuan business, to be sure. But in relative terms, there are many other companies that are expanding at a much faster pace. Similarly, it is very likely that Apple is facing some headwinds due to its comprehensive penetration of its core markets like smartphones, which are also highly competitive.\n\nMy mistake here was to assume that the boom times both could and would continue forever with Apple. There is no guarantee that the stock will fall, and it's still a favorable investment.\n\nBut the only way to avoid the unanticipated consequences of complacency is to invest some effort and do the diligence even if there are not any major changes happening in any given quarter, so that's what I'll be doing from now on with this stock.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you\u2019ll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a \u201cDouble Down\u201d stock recommendation\u00a0for companies that they think are about to pop.

Cramer started the show by talking about healthcare stocks and said \"Healthcare really hasn't had much of a move so I think those stocks, honestly a safe haven with interest rates going higher.\"\n\nHe added that the US government's export control rules to protect American national security interests were hitting markets hard. According to Cramer \"I still expect 5% to hit on the ten-year [bond] but I've got to tell you the tone is hideous, I think the tone is being set by the Biden administration, doing a last minute 200-page ruling about who can get AI and who can't.\" He added \"And then David, I've got to tell you, I think the Zuckerberg interview on Joe Rogan was seminal.\" The reason behind it was that Zuckerberg's thoughts about the firm behind the iPhone indicated \"you're done, nothing since Steve Jobs, one one of the most offensive interviews I've heard in a very long time.\n\nReturning to the rate cuts, Cramer asserted again that the Fed had misjudged the economy by lower rates in December. According to him \"The whole concept of the rate cuts, as opposed to one or two rate cuts, gotta be off the table because it looks like we've had some very serious misjudgment by the Fed.\"\n\nAs for the fires, Cramer started by stating that there's \"Not enough talk about the fires.\" The day this show was aired, he was covering the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference. Cramer outlined \"I certainly wanna ask everyone at the healthcare conference, what can happen, in terms of public health, what can happen in terms of asthma.\" Along with healthcare problems arising from the disaster, he added \"But more important as you know, Carl, the loss of life, the destruction, so immense, it's going to impact the economy. We don't even know yet, what could be the results.\"\n\nOne industry that's been at the center of media coverage whether it's for disasters or healthcare is the insurance industry. Talking about insurance, Cramer revealed, \"Well I have to tell you, the insurance regime out here in California is so strict that you have to wonder why bother to write anything. There's a loss-sharing agreement that's terrible, there is a sense to me that it's going to take longer to come back than people realize. David, the rebuild will be immense, it's obviously not done.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nHe added \"And I think that if we're going to talk about what the economy, what's going to happen, one-fifth of the country is California. Obviously, this is just the South end, could be contained to Los Angeles. But you know David this is one of those things we can't really factor in but we must factor in, in terms of trying to figure out what it's gonna mean for the whole US economy.\"\n\nThe CNBC host also shared his thoughts on some of the reasons behind the wildfires. \"Yeah look I think that we're gonna look at this, we're gonna say, there are reasons why this happened. Reservoirs not working. Some issues, whether the firefighters were ready.\" Linking the calamity with interest rates, he commented, \"But you know Carl the most important this is at least, if we're going to talk about the economy, if we're going to talk about the rate cuts versus rate increases, it may be a reason that we have to put things on a pause. Maybe when the smoke clears. Proverbial smoke and literal. It may mean that things are going to be slower.\"\n\nCramer then returned to Zuckerberg's podcast appearance. According to him \"Zuckerberg. I mean I gotta hand it to him, I mean he basically made the Justice Department's case against\" the iPhone designer. He added \"It's almost as if he sat down with, with the outgoing administration, Jonathan Kanter, and said, look let me tell you what I think\" the firm is doing. Cramer concluded \"Because everything that he's complaining about, the Justice Department is complaining about. Carl, it was one of the most damming interviews. I couldn't tell whether Mark was having fun, or whether he was just basically saying Apple is the axis of evil and others that play along because they all are scared. . . And he's not scared. He's tough. Taekwondo. .\u00a0 .it's a libertarian love fest.\"\n\nAs for whether Zuckerberg's remarks were made to buttress his relationship with the incoming Trump administration, Cramer commented \"Well he's, let's call him savvy. He talked about libertarian, but there were these moments, you know he lives on a ranch, and he has to shoot pigs. Okay, so he's pro-gun.\" However, Cramer added, \"At one point, . . .it did have a kind of element of extremism that I'm not used to anyone having.\" He also speculated whether Zuckerberg was aware of how he sounded during the interview. According to Cramer:\n\n\"And I think that Joe Rogan is sophisticated enough to be able to put a line out for Mark to really go for it. I don't know whether Mark realizes exactly how damming it sounds, and I think that it's a little of a shame if only just because he made me feel like that he himself really despises a company that we all love. I wish that there'd been some push back.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired recently\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Apple Inc (AAPL): AI Innovations Shaping the Future\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics giant that earns billions of dollars through its iconic iPhone. The smartphone is also a central part of its hypothesis as half of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s revenue comes from it. The firm's reliance on the iPhone and its closed ecosystem came under fire from Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg's recent appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast. Zuckerberg said that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) hadn't innovated since the death of its iconic founder Steve Jobs. Cramer took aim at these and other comments made by Zuckerberg:\n\n\"[On Zuckerberg saying Apple hasn't done anything since the iPhone] I. . [laughs hysterically] don't know what to say. I mean, David, look, I don't want to make it too central an issue because it was a love fest, a libertarian love fest, uh but David the one thing [that] is absolutely certain was that if you really want to say the most horrible things about Apple, you say first of all that nothing's been done since Jobs, two that they lock out everything, three that they make every single innovation, hold it.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

                "reasoning": "The comments made by Jim Cramer regarding Apple Inc. (AAPL) reflect a mixed sentiment. While he acknowledges the criticisms from Mark Zuckerberg about Apple's innovation since Steve Jobs, he also highlights the broader economic concerns related to interest rates and the impact of the California wildfires. Cramer's remarks suggest a cautious outlook on the economy, which could negatively affect investor sentiment towards AAPL. However, the company's strong market position and ongoing innovations may mitigate some of the negative sentiment. Overall, the probabilities reflect a higher chance of a price decline due to the critical comments and economic concerns, but not overwhelmingly so."

                "reasoning": "The news article presents a mixed bag of information. While it highlights Jim Cramer's commentary on various market factors like interest rates, wildfires, and Zuckerberg's criticism of Apple, the direct impact on Apple's stock price is debatable. Cramer's mention of Zuckerberg's negative comments about Apple's innovation since Steve Jobs could negatively impact investor sentiment. However, the article also mentions Apple's strong position as a consumer electronics giant and its reliance on the iPhone for revenue. The article also mentions that AAPL ranks 3rd on a list of stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. The overall tone is slightly negative due to the criticism of Apple's innovation, but the company's strong fundamentals and market position provide some counterbalance. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a stock price fall than a rise."

                "reasoning": "Jim Cramer's comments are mixed and don't provide a clear direction for Apple's stock price. While he dismisses Mark Zuckerberg's criticism of Apple's post-Jobs innovation as 'ill-advised', the fact that Zuckerberg's comments were even made and received significant media attention could negatively impact investor sentiment.  The overall news piece is quite broad, covering wildfires, interest rates, and political commentary, making it difficult to isolate the impact on Apple specifically.  Zuckerberg's criticism, while dismissed by Cramer, highlights a potential vulnerability: over-reliance on the iPhone and a perceived lack of recent groundbreaking innovation.  The positive aspects are largely absent from the news piece itself.  Therefore, the probability of a price rise is considered lower than the probability of a price fall, but neither is overwhelmingly likely based solely on this news."

                "reasoning": "The news article primarily discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL) in the context of broader market and economic issues, including California wildfires, interest rates, and Mark Zuckerberg's critical remarks about Apple's innovation post-Steve Jobs. While Zuckerberg's comments could be seen as negative for Apple's reputation, the article does not provide concrete financial or operational data that would directly impact Apple's stock price. Cramer's reaction to Zuckerberg's comments was mixed, and the broader discussion was more about macroeconomic factors than Apple-specific news. Given the lack of direct negative or positive catalysts in the news, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely neutral or minimal. However, the slight negative sentiment from Zuckerberg's comments might have a marginal effect."

                "reasoning": "The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL) in response to Mark Zuckerberg's recent interview where he stated that Apple hasn't innovated since Steve Jobs' death. Cramer strongly disagreed with Zuckerberg's assessment, calling it 'ill-advised' and 'one of the most offensive interviews I've heard in a very long time.' Cramer's defense of Apple and his criticism of Zuckerberg's comments could be perceived positively by investors, potentially leading to a rise in Apple's stock price. However, the impact might be limited as Cramer's opinions, although influential, are subjective and may not significantly alter the overall market perception of Apple's innovation and stock performance."

However, the article also mentions that Cramer's comments were part of a broader discussion on various topics, including the California wildfires, interest rates, and the insurance industry. The article concludes by mentioning that Apple ranks 3rd on the list of stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed, but suggests that other AI stocks may hold greater promise for delivering higher returns. Based on this analysis, the news is somewhat negative for Apple, but not significantly so. The criticism from Zuckerberg and Cramer's reaction may have a minor impact on the stock price, but it is unlikely to be a major driver of the stock's performance."

        "content": "TikTok is running again in the United States after President-elect Donald Trump announced Sunday via Truth Social (DJT) that he will issue an executive order on Monday to extend the period of time before a ban takes effect \"so that we can make a deal to protect our national security.\"\n\nHere is TikTok's statement:\n\n\"In agreement with our service providers, TikTok is in the process of restoring service. We thank President Trump for providing the necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties providing TikTok to over 170 million Americans and allowing over 7 million small businesses to thrive. It\u2019s a strong stand for the First Amendment and against arbitrary censorship. We will work with President Trump on a long-term solution that keeps TikTok in the United States.\"\n\nTikTok briefly shut down in the United States on Saturday evening. The social media app went dark after the US Supreme Court determined that national security concerns outweighed TikTok's First Amendment argument against a law that was signed in April 2024.

                "reasoning": "The news indicates a positive development for Apple. The potential ban of TikTok in the US would have likely benefited Apple's App Store by reducing competition and potentially driving users to alternative platforms available on iOS. However, the reversal of the ban, even temporarily, removes this potential benefit. While the news doesn't directly harm Apple, it eliminates a potential tailwind. The market's reaction will likely be neutral to slightly negative, as the uncertainty surrounding TikTok's future remains. The fact that ByteDance chose not to divest despite having interested buyers suggests a continued willingness to fight the ban, which could lead to further volatility and uncertainty. Given the overall market sentiment and Apple's size, the impact is likely to be muted. The news is more impactful for ByteDance and potentially other social media companies."

However, any positive sentiment around the tech sector due to the resolution of a potential ban on a major app could indirectly benefit Apple. Conversely, negative sentiment around tech regulation could have a slight negative impact. Overall, the probabilities are balanced with a slight tilt towards no significant change."

The shutdown and subsequent return of TikTok could imply regulatory shifts or market dynamics changes, but these are not directly tied to Apple's core business operations or stock performance in a straightforward manner.

        "content": "Investors brace for a bumpy ride as President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s second term gets underway on Monday, bringing the promise of significant policy shifts \u2014 including lighter regulation and tax cuts.\n\nThose two priorities have Wall Street upbeat, while cooling inflation and strong earnings have also fueled investor optimism. This past week, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) clocked its best weekly performance since the election. Since Nov. 5, the S&P 500 has climbed 3.6%.\n\nYet some areas of the market could be at risk, as Trump\u2019s unpredictable approach is largely expected to trigger market volatility.\n\nIn recent weeks, I\u2019ve spoken with several top CEOs and Wall Street analysts about what Trump 2.0 means for businesses and investors. Here\u2019s what they told me about the incoming administration\u2019s expected impact across various sectors.\n\nWinning trades under Trump: Financials, industrials, airlines, crypto\n\nFinancials\n\nFinancials is viewed as a top trade as investors bet on looser regulation and increased M&A activity. Just this week, the nation\u2019s largest banks reported a surge in corporate profits.\n\n\"There has been a meaningful shift in CEO confidence, particularly following the results of the US election,\" Goldman Sachs (GS) CEO David Solomon said on the bank\u2019s earnings call. \u201cIt feels like we have a tailwind going into 2025.\"\n\nMeanwhile, JPMorgan (JPM) CFO Jeremy Barnum cited a \u201csignificant amount of increase of optimism in the overall environment,\u201d telling reporters following the bank\u2019s earnings results that \u201cwe\u2019re in an animal-spirits moment right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to have a more level, less volatile regulatory environment,\u201d Chris Whalen, chairman of Whalen Global Advisors, told me on Yahoo Finance\u2019s Morning Brief. \u201cHaving banks manage their business on whether or not [Senator] Elizabeth Warren is going to attack them or not is absurd. You can't run a business that way.\u201d\n\nGabelli Funds portfolio manager Mac Sykes expects lighter oversight of the banking industry to be a catalyst for the group, telling Yahoo Finance that deregulation will \u201cbenefit the banks.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was a 10% hit that was coming [from Basel III endgame], and that probably will go to neutral,\u201d Sykes said. He also added that increased M&A within the sector will allow smaller players to take advantage of synergies, an outcome that\u2019s being \u201cunderappreciated by investors.\u201d\n\nIndustrials\n\nGoldman Sachs analyst Joe Ritchie told me last month that the industrial sector is gaining confidence after months of contraction, adding \u201cseveral companies are expecting better growth in 2025 \u2026 It\u2019s only a matter of time before it happens.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nHEICO (HEI) co-president Eric Mendelson is among the group\u2019s business leaders who see Trump\u2019s policies boosting investor confidence in the economy, creating a \u201cvery positive environment\u201d for the industrial sector.\n\nAnd Elon Musk\u2019s influence on the incoming administration could be another catalyst. Robert Cardillo, chief strategist of Planet Labs (PL), told me last month at the Goldman Sachs Industrial and Materials conference that Musk\u2019s impact will likely be \u201cgood news\u201d for the sector.\n\nAirlines\n\nIndustry leaders and experts are expecting the incoming administration to create a supportive backdrop for the sector.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s constructive in a lot of ways \u2026 The tax efforts I think are constructive. The regulatory environment I hope is also more constructive for the industry,\u201d Southwest (LUV) CEO Bob Jordan told me last month.\n\nAnd industry watchers are predicting significant changes to the air transportation and aerospace sector, including plans to scale back the Biden administration's consumer protection initiatives and reduce regulations affecting the commercial space and advanced air mobility industries, according to recent analysis from Pillsbury law firm\u2019s aviation team.\n\n\u201cWe anticipate seeing support from the Trump Administration for joint-ventures, mergers and/or acquisition efforts by smaller airlines to compete more effectively with the larger U.S. airlines,\u201d Pillsbury\u2019s Charles Donley, Edward Sauer, and Laura Jennings Ochoa wrote.\n\nThat sentiment is being echoed by top industry analysts.\n\n\u201cBetween the new administration\u2019s stance as well as some of the smaller airlines struggling, there's a better chance of M&A now \u2026 that's an upside for the group and definitely a higher likelihood in 2025 than what we've seen these past few years,\u201d Raymond James\u2019s Savanthi Syth told me.\n\nTech\n\nBig Tech leaders are cozying up to President-elect Donald Trump due to his plans to peel back regulations and invest heavily in AI.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos, Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook, Alphabet (GOOGL) CEO Sundar Pichai, Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg, and Microsoft (MSFT) CEO Satya Nadella are among tech leaders who contributed funds to Trump\u2019s inauguration campaign as Big Tech tries to win the backing of the new administration.\n\nNasdaqGS - Delayed Quote\u2022USD\n\n(META)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\n612.77\n\n-\n\n+(0.24%)\n\nAt close: January 17 at 4:00:01 PM EST  METAAAPL GOOGL\n\nAdvanced Chart\n\nWedbush\u2019s Dan Ives expects the technology sector to be a big winner this year, predicting a \u201cGoldilocks\u201d scenario for Big Tech.\n\n\u201cWe expect tech stocks to be up 25% in 2025 as the Street further digests a less regulatory spider web under Trump in the White House with Khan/FTC days in the rear-view mirror, stronger AI initiatives within the Beltway on the way, and a goldilocks foundation for Big Tech and Tesla looking into 2025 and beyond,\u201d Ives wrote in a note to clients.\n\nIBM (IBM) CEO Arvind Krishna told me at Yahoo Finance\u2019s Invest conference that he\u2019s hopeful the incoming Trump administration will foster \u201ca lot more innovation and less regulation,\u201d laying the groundwork for a more favorable deal environment.\n\n\u201cIf we have more certainty on the outcome, then we are willing to lean into things like M&A. \u2026 If the regulatory process and antitrust are going to be more certain, that allows you to take more risk,\u201d Krishna said.\n\nLosing trades under Trump: Automakers, retailers, construction\n\nAutomakers\n\nPlans by the incoming administration to roll back the Biden administration\u2019s EV policies on day one, along with threats of tariffs, pose a risk to the automotive sector.\n\nTom Donnelly, president and CEO of Mazda North American Operations, told me it\u2019s \u201cpotentially\u201d more difficult to do business under Trump given the unpredictability surrounding his administration and the potential for more tariffs. He told Yahoo Finance that Mazda has been \u201cscenario planning\u201d for months, which includes potentially shifting some of its production from Mexico to its plant in Alabama.\n\n\u201cUncertainty isn\u2019t beneficial,\u201d Donnelly told me. \u201cWhat's clear is no business in any industry can absorb the magnitude of what's being talked about here.\u201d\n\nSince Election Day, Trump has threatened a slew of tariffs, ranging from a gradual implementation to a 25% tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico and a 60% tariff on Chinese goods.\n\nTariffs on Canada and Mexico, in particular, are expected to be an overhang for the auto sector this year. Evercore\u2019s Chris McNally remains \u201crelatively cautious\u201d on the entire legacy auto group until there\u2019s a resolution on Trump\u2019s tariff threats, warning of an earnings hit to some of the industry\u2019s largest players.\n\n\u201cGeneral Motors (GM) has the highest negative EPS exposure to a 25% Mexico Tariff in the whopping range of 45%-50% EPS hit if implemented,\u201d McNally wrote in a note to clients earlier this month.\n\nRBC\u2019s Tom Narayan sees Trump\u2019s \u201cerratic\u201d behavior as a risk to the industry and expects Trump\u2019s threat of tariffs to \u201ccontinue to pressure\u201d auto stocks until the industry gains some clarity.\n\nDiscount retailers\n\nDiscount retailers are among the stocks most at risk of tariffs, as the group relies heavily on Chinese imports.\n\nFor example, nearly a third of products sold at Boot Barn (BOOT) are produced in China, while 25% are produced in Mexico, according to recent analysis from Bank of America\u2019s Christopher Nardone.\n\nDollar Tree (DLTR) CEO Michael Creedon noted on the company\u2019s third quarter earnings call that the retailer has policies in place to mitigate risk associated with tariffs, including the ability to \u201celiminate the product altogether.\u201d\n\nConstruction\n\nTrump\u2019s promise of mass deportations, along with tariffs, is a risk to the construction industry.\n\n\u201cHigher tariffs on Canada and Mexico and mass deportations of undocumented immigrants could increase costs for materials and labor. Higher tariffs on China could slow its economy, causing land developers to slow their investments,\u201d S&P Global Ratings wrote in a recent note.\n\nThe team notes that softwood lumber, which is used to frame buildings, is often imported from Canada, while drywall and cement component gypsum is often imported from both Mexico and Canada.\n\nAnd that sentiment was echoed by Realtor.com\u2019s senior economist Joel Berner, who warned that higher costs will slow building activity.\n\n\u201cPolicy initiatives of the incoming Trump administration, which has promised tariffs on imported goods that include construction materials and mass deportations that will impact builders\u2019 labor forces, surely have come into play as builders slow down in terms of initiating new building projects,\u201d Berner wrote.\n\nSeana Smith is an anchor at Yahoo Finance.

The expectation of lighter regulations and increased investment in AI under the incoming Trump administration is likely to boost investor confidence in tech stocks. Analysts predict a significant rise in tech stocks, with estimates of a 25% increase in 2025. Given Apple's position as a major player in the tech sector and the favorable sentiment surrounding it, the probability of its stock price rising is high. However, there is still some uncertainty due to potential market volatility associated with Trump's unpredictable policies, which could lead to a lower probability of a price fall but still a non-negligible risk."

While the article highlights a general optimism in the market due to potential tax cuts and deregulation, it also mentions the risk of volatility due to Trump's unpredictable policies. Specifically for tech, the article notes that Big Tech leaders are trying to cozy up to Trump due to his plans to peel back regulations and invest heavily in AI. Apple's CEO is mentioned as one of the tech leaders contributing to Trump's inauguration campaign. Wedbush's Dan Ives expects the technology sector to be a big winner this year, predicting a \u201cGoldilocks\u201d scenario for Big Tech. However, the article also mentions potential negative impacts from tariffs, which could affect Apple's supply chain and manufacturing costs. Considering these factors, the positive sentiment towards tech and Apple's efforts to align with the administration seem to outweigh the potential negative impacts of tariffs, but the uncertainty of Trump's policies still introduces some risk."

                "reasoning": "The news article focuses on the potential impact of a second Trump term on various sectors. While the article highlights a generally positive outlook for the market due to lighter regulation and tax cuts, the impact on Apple is less directly addressed.  The article mentions that Big Tech companies, including Apple, are attempting to gain favor with the new administration through campaign contributions.  This suggests a potential for positive relations, but doesn't guarantee a stock price increase.  The article's overall tone is cautiously optimistic, with warnings about potential market volatility and negative impacts on certain sectors (automakers, retailers, construction).  Apple, being in the tech sector, is predicted to benefit from less regulation and increased AI investment. However, the overall market volatility and the indirect nature of the news regarding Apple make it difficult to assign a high probability to either a rise or fall.  Therefore, the probabilities are assigned to reflect this uncertainty, leaning slightly towards a rise due to the positive outlook for the tech sector."

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nCoverage of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, each year is something I view as a competitive sport.\n\nI actually start training for the intense week over the summer, as my few close friends know (and yes, they all make fun of me). The number of workouts every week in the lead-up rises incrementally so I can easily sprint up and down the two-mile promenade with a backpack to stuff in as many meetings as humanly possible (yes, I do this).\n\nMy one cheat meal a week gets replaced by green drinks and extra doses of vitamins to ensure I don't get sick. I meditate twice a day and carefully pick out clothes I know will help me execute at the highest level. Look good, feel good, good things happen.\n\nTo me, this one event is the closest I will get to being like Michael Jordan in the playoffs \u2014 and I am very lucky to be in attendance.\n\nAnd this year, the gathering of the elites flying in on private jets to wax poetic on the world's biggest problems will be extra nutty.\n\nRead more: Here are the biggest global risks for 2025\n\nThe conference unofficially kicks off on Trump's Inauguration Day. Some CEOs I know who normally would be at Davos all week are dropping in mid-week after working the inauguration party rounds. By Tuesday, the newly minted president may have uncorked a host of executive orders that could impact the businesses of the top CEOs on the ground. And, of course, impact the global markets.\n\nThis is why this year's WEF will be more important than the norm for you, the average investor. The headlines will be coming in hot and heavy as CEOs look to challenge Trump or get on his good side. They will also look to talk up their businesses ahead of the start of earnings season, and with markets getting a little rockier of late.\n\nHere's what yours truly and our very own Jennifer Schonberger will be watching while bundled up in five layers all week. Be sure to bookmark the \"streaming now\" section on Yahoo Finance to catch all our market-moving interviews in real-time. Or tune in where you normally catch us, whether that's on Samsung TV or our nifty app.\n\nUnlike our previous trips to Davos over the past decade, I will be taping several special episodes of the Opening Bid podcast on the ground. I could tell you who those guests will be, but where is the fun in that? Best to be surprised!\n\nStory Continues\n\nNow, on to that guide...\n\nBig bank CEOs: The biggest names in banking, such as JPMorgan (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon, Bank of America (BAC) CEO Brian Moynihan, Goldman Sachs (GS) CEO David Solomon, Citi (C) CEO Jane Fraser, and Morgan Stanley (MS) CEO Ted Pick will be in attendance. While this group will all get asked about Trump policies, it's going to be their outlook on interest rates that will be most key to market sentiment. Most have not spoken publicly since the Fed signaled a likely halt in rate cuts last month, and they will want to be heard ahead of the Fed's Jan. 28-29 policy meeting.\n\nThe tariff CEOs: Retail will have a nice showing at Davos, with the CEOs of Polo Ralph Lauren (RL), Williams Sonoma (WSM), and Gap (GAP) (their CEO's first time at the event) making the rounds. These companies are right in the middle of the tariff debate. I'll be interested in how they are preparing for Trump tariffs from a supply chain perspective. I am also interested in how much they could raise prices post-tariffs \u2014 it could offer up valuable insight into the 2025 inflation outlook and Fed policy.\n\nThe race to catch Nvidia: It will be another year of AI chatter throughout the halls of Davos. This time, I think the discussions will take two forms. First, unlike last year, where the AI discussions were mostly about potential, investors are going to want to see clear lines to revenue and profits. So I encourage AI CEOs to bring it. And two, we will probably hear more about how Big Tech players in Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL) are aiming to develop their own high-powered AI chips to catch Nvidia (NVDA), or at least make good enough chips to diversify. Leaders from OpenAI and Anthropic will also be in attendance, and their thoughts on chips could be key. I'll be watching Nvidia's stock price like a hawk this week, and you should be as well.\n\nCrypto delegation: The crypto industry has had a solid presence at Davos in the past five years. This year the industry is expected to be out in force, headlined by an appearance from Coinbase (COIN) CEO Brian Armstrong. I'll be quite attuned to what the crypto crowd thinks about the latest volatility in bitcoin, MicroStrategy's (MSTR) bitcoin buying binge, what they are hearing from the pro-crypto Trump administration, and early assessments on Paul Atkins as the likely next SEC chairman.\n\nAnd of course, the new Trump coin that debuted to much fanfare (and market cap) on Friday.\n\nStocks: Stocks are beginning to look top-heavy (especially the Magnificent 7), as I have reported. I'm eager to hear from market pros such as JPMorgan's Mary Erdoes and economic experts like Nouriel Roubini on if they are seeing red flags on the horizon. Any calls they make at this Davos may hold greater weight given more volatile market conditions and increased Trump policy uncertainty.\n\nThe political wild cards: As of this writing, contacts have told me President-elect Donald Trump plans to send delegates to Davos. Who precisely gets the nod is the wild card. (I fancy it will be potential Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, a Davos party scene regular for many years. Elon has long hated Davos, so hard to see him appearing). Trump himself is slated to give a speech remotely on Thursday, a source told Yahoo Finance.\n\nBut who ultimately shows up from Trump's orbit \u2014 and what they say once touching down \u2014 could set the tone on US international relations right out of the gate. If a delegate arrives at Davos days after Trump takes actions that could weigh on the economic growth of foreign countries and then aims to explain the actions, best believe the inevitable headlines may not be so market-friendly.\n\n\u2014\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

The mention of 'stocks beginning to look top-heavy (especially the Magnificent 7)' is a negative signal for Apple, as it is a member of that group. The uncertainty surrounding Trump's policies and potential trade wars could negatively impact Apple's supply chain and international sales.

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nCoverage of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, each year is something I view as a competitive sport.\n\nI actually start training for the intense week over the summer, as my few close friends know (and yes, they all make fun of me). The number of workouts every week in the lead-up rises incrementally so I can easily sprint up and down the two-mile promenade with a backpack to stuff in as many meetings as humanly possible (yes, I do this).\n\nMy one cheat meal a week gets replaced by green drinks and extra doses of vitamins to ensure I don't get sick. I meditate twice a day and carefully pick out clothes I know will help me execute at the highest level. Look good, feel good, good things happen.\n\nTo me, this one event is the closest I will get to being like Michael Jordan in the playoffs \u2014 and I am very lucky to be in attendance.\n\nAnd this year, the gathering of the elites flying in on private jets to wax poetic on the world's biggest problems will be extra nutty.\n\nRead more: Here are the biggest global risks for 2025\n\nThe conference unofficially kicks off on Trump's Inauguration Day. Some CEOs I know who normally would be at Davos all week are dropping in mid-week after working the inauguration party rounds. By Tuesday, the newly minted president may have uncorked a host of executive orders that could impact the businesses of the top CEOs on the ground. And, of course, impact the global markets.\n\nThis is why this year's WEF will be more important than the norm for you, the average investor. The headlines will be coming in hot and heavy as CEOs look to challenge Trump or get on his good side. They will also look to talk up their businesses ahead of the start of earnings season, and with markets getting a little rockier of late.\n\nHere's what yours truly and our very own Jennifer Schonberger will be watching while bundled up in five layers all week. Be sure to bookmark the \"streaming now\" section on Yahoo Finance to catch all our market-moving interviews in real time. Or tune in where you normally catch us, whether that's on Samsung TV or our nifty app.\n\nUnlike our previous trips to Davos over the past decade, I will be taping several special episodes of the Opening Bid podcast on the ground. I could tell you who those guests will be, but where is the fun in that? Best to be surprised!\n\nStory Continues\n\nNow, on to that guide...\n\nBig bank CEOs: The biggest names in banking, such as JPMorgan (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon, Bank of America (BAC) CEO Brian Moynihan, Goldman Sachs (GS) CEO David Solomon, Citi (C) CEO Jane Fraser, and Morgan Stanley (MS) CEO Ted Pick will be in attendance. While this group will all get asked about Trump policies, it's going to be their outlook on interest rates that will be most key to market sentiment. Most have not spoken publicly since the Fed signaled a likely halt in rate cuts last month, and they will want to be heard ahead of the Fed's Jan. 28-29 policy meeting.\n\nThe tariff CEOs: Retail will have a nice showing at Davos, with the CEOs of Polo Ralph Lauren (RL), Williams Sonoma (WSM), and Gap (GAP) (their CEO's first time at the event) making the rounds. These companies are right in the middle of the tariff debate. I'll be interested in how they are preparing for Trump tariffs from a supply chain perspective. I am also interested in how much they could raise prices post-tariffs \u2014 it could offer valuable insight into the 2025 inflation outlook and Fed policy.\n\nRead more: How do tariffs work, and who really pays them?\n\nThe race to catch Nvidia: It will be another year of artificial intelligence chatter throughout the halls of Davos. This time, I think the discussions will take two forms. First, unlike last year, where the AI discussions were mostly about potential, investors are going to want to see clear lines to revenue and profits. So I encourage AI CEOs to bring it. And two, we will probably hear more about how Big Tech players in Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL) are aiming to develop their own high-powered AI chips to catch Nvidia (NVDA), or at least make good enough chips to diversify. Leaders from OpenAI and Anthropic will also be in attendance, and their thoughts on chips could be key. I'll be watching Nvidia's stock price like a hawk this week, and you should be as well.\n\nCrypto delegation: The crypto industry has had a solid presence at Davos in the past five years. This year, the industry is expected to be out in force, headlined by an appearance from Coinbase (COIN) CEO Brian Armstrong. I'll be quite attuned to what the crypto crowd thinks about the latest volatility in bitcoin, MicroStrategy's (MSTR) bitcoin buying binge, what they are hearing from the pro-crypto Trump administration, and early assessments on Paul Atkins as the likely next SEC chairman.\n\nAnd of course, the new Trump coin that debuted to much fanfare (and market cap) on Friday.\n\nThe token quickly rose to a market cap of $73 billion in about 48 hours, surpassing DOGE as the largest meme coin so far.\n\nThe market cap of the crypto has since dropped to $12 billion from its launch, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nStocks: Stocks are beginning to look top-heavy (especially the Magnificent 7), as I have reported. I'm eager to hear from market pros such as JPMorgan's Mary Erdoes and economic experts like Nouriel Roubini on whether they are seeing red flags on the horizon. Any calls they make at this Davos may hold greater weight given more volatile market conditions and increased Trump policy uncertainty.\n\nThe political wild cards: As of this writing, contacts have told me President-elect Donald Trump plans to send delegates to Davos. Who precisely gets the nod is the wild card. (I fancy it will be potential Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, a Davos party scene regular for many years. Elon has long hated Davos, so hard to see him appearing). Trump himself is slated to give a speech remotely on Thursday, a source told Yahoo Finance.\n\nBut who ultimately shows up from Trump's orbit \u2014 and what they say once touching down \u2014 could set the tone on US international relations right out of the gate. If a delegate arrives at Davos days after Trump takes actions that could weigh on the economic growth of foreign countries and then aims to explain the actions, best believe the inevitable headlines may not be so market-friendly.\n\n\u2014\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

Given that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a major player in the tech sector, any discussions regarding tariffs and economic policies could directly impact its stock price. The mention of volatility in the markets and the potential for negative headlines from the event suggests a cautious outlook. However, if Apple can leverage discussions around AI and its market position positively, there could be upward pressure on its stock. Overall, the uncertainty surrounding the event and potential negative impacts leads to a higher probability of a stock price fall compared to a rise."

While Apple is not explicitly mentioned as a key player at Davos in this article, the general market sentiment and potential policy changes discussed could indirectly affect Apple. The article highlights several factors that could influence market volatility, including Trump's policies, interest rate outlook from bank CEOs, tariff discussions, and the AI race. The article mentions that stocks are beginning to look top-heavy (especially the Magnificent 7), which includes Apple. This suggests a potential downward pressure on Apple's stock. The uncertainty surrounding Trump's policies and potential tariffs could also negatively impact Apple, given its global supply chain and reliance on international markets. The AI race, while potentially beneficial in the long run, could create short-term uncertainty and increased competition. Overall, the news leans slightly negative for Apple due to the general market concerns and potential policy risks. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than the probability of a rise."

The uncertainty surrounding Trump's policies and their potential impact on global markets adds to the overall risk.  The focus on AI and Nvidia's position in the market could be seen as a positive for Apple's AI initiatives, but this is less direct than the negative factors.  Overall, the news creates a climate of uncertainty, with more potential downside risks than upside based on the information provided. The lack of specific mention of Apple makes it difficult to assign a high probability to either outcome."

        "headline": "Why Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) Among Louis Navellier\u2019s Top Long-term Stock Picks?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Louis Navellier's Top 15 Long-Term Stock Picks.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other Louis Navellier's top long-term stock picks.\n\nLouis Navellier is a prominent American investor, author, and financial analyst, best known for his quantitative approach to stock selection and his long-standing track record in the investment industry. As the founder and chairman of Navellier & Associates, a private investment management firm, he has built a reputation for identifying high-growth stocks with significant upside potential. Navellier\u2019s approach blends rigorous quantitative analysis with a focus on fundamental factors, positioning him as a leading voice in growth investing.\n\nBorn in 1957, Navellier developed an early interest in the stock market. He honed his analytical skills while studying at California State University, where he earned a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Finance. It was during his college years that Navellier discovered his passion for quantitative analysis, developing a stock-picking system as part of a class project. This project laid the foundation for his career, as he created a system to identify market-beating stocks using specific growth and valuation criteria.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nIn 1980, Navellier founded Navellier & Associates, which has grown into a respected investment management firm catering to high-net-worth individuals and institutional clients. Over the years, the firm has managed billions of dollars in assets, applying Navellier\u2019s quantitative methodology to identify outperforming stocks. Navellier is also widely known for publishing the Navellier Growth newsletter, where he shares stock recommendations and insights into market trends. In his newsletter-based recommendations, many stocks have achieved annualized returns exceeding 20% during high-growth market periods.\n\nNavellier\u2019s approach focuses on finding stocks that exhibit strong growth characteristics while maintaining sound fundamentals. He relies heavily on quantitative analysis, utilizing algorithms and statistical models to screen for stocks with high revenue and earnings growth, solid profit margins, and favorable valuation metrics. Unlike many value investors who prioritize underpriced securities, Navellier embraces growth investing, emphasizing companies with strong momentum and the potential for rapid expansion. This strategy often leads him to sectors like technology, healthcare, and consumer goods.\n\nStory Continues\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nFor this article, we selected stocks by combing through the 13F portfolio of Navellier & Associates at the end of the third quarter of 2024. Only the companies that have been in the 13F portfolio of the fund consistently for the past three years were selected. These stocks are also popular among other hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Apple Inc (AAPL): AI Innovations Shaping the Future\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nNavellier & Associates\u2019 Stake: $13.4 million\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. The first factor that makes this company an appealing investment opportunity is its robust financial performance. In the fourth quarter of the fiscal year of 2024, the company reported revenue of $94.9 billion, a 6% increase year-over-year. The operating income for the quarter was $27.9 billion, reflecting a 15% increase compared to the same period in the prior year. The second most pertinent factor that makes Apple a great investment opportunity is its integration of Apple Intelligence in all its products to enhance productivity and meet the evolving needs of the world. Siri\u2019s improved neutral language processing, the Apple Neural Engine (ANE) for machine learning tasks, and AI-driven tools within iOS are some of the AI advancements that investors should take note of. Moreover, Apple has recently announced plans to expand recycled material across its products, including a new 2025 target to use 100% recycled cobalt in all batteries designed by Apple. This strategy positions the company as a leader in environmentally conscious manufacturing.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 5th on our list of Louis Navellier's top long-term stock picks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for a stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

However, the article also states that other stocks may offer higher returns in a shorter timeframe, suggesting that AAPL might not be the absolute best choice for aggressive growth investors. The fact that AAPL is already widely held (158 hedge fund holders) suggests that much of the positive news may already be priced in. Overall, the news is mildly positive, but the caveat about potentially better alternatives tempers the bullish sentiment. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a price rise than a fall, but not overwhelmingly so."

        "headline": "Here's How Much You Could Earn in Dividends From a $350,000 Investment in the \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks",
        "content": "The technology companies nicknamed the \"Magnificent Seven\" have a combined value of $17.2 trillion, which represents one-third of the entire value of the S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC). Those stocks delivered an average return of 60% during 2024, making them responsible for more than half of the S&P's 25% gain.NVDA data by YCharts.\n\nIn other words, investors whose portfolios didn't include the Magnificent Seven stocks last year probably underperformed the broader market by a wide margin. Since these seven companies dominate different areas of the technology industry, including new segments like artificial intelligence (AI), they are likely to continue driving the S&P 500 higher.\n\nBut some investors don't just want massive capital gains. They want regular income, and some Magnificent Seven stocks also pay dividends. Unfortunately, as you'll see below, dividend investors won't get big payouts even from a massive $350,000 investment split equally across the seven stocks.\n\nWhat's driving the Magnificent Seven now\n\nAI is the primary growth driver across most of the tech sector right now, which is why Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) was the best-performing stock in the Magnificent Seven last year. The company's graphics processing units (GPUs) are the top choice for those who are developing AI models, and demand is outstripping supply because every tech company needs them to keep up with the competition.\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT), Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), and Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) are among Nvidia's biggest customers. They are filling their data centers with Nvidia's chips to develop their own AI software, but they also rent computing capacity to businesses and other AI developers. Their customers can also access state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) from companies like OpenAI and Anthropic via Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services, and Google Cloud.\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) has embedded AI into its recommendation engines on Facebook and Instagram with the goal of more accurately curating the content they deliver to each user to suit their preferences. This keeps people online for longer periods of time, which allows Meta to show them more ads and earn more revenue. And later this year, it expects to launch its Llama 4 LLM, which could be the most advanced in the industry.\n\nThen there is Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), which is on track to become the largest distributor of AI to consumers through its 2.2 billion active devices worldwide. The company recently debuted its Apple Intelligence software with a suite of new features that work only on its latest iPhones, iPads, and Mac computers. Apple Intelligence will create new opportunities for the company to generate software revenue, and also may encourage customers to upgrade their devices sooner.\n\nStory Continues\n\nFinally, Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) might be known as one of the world's largest manufacturers of electric vehicles, but Wall Street is increasingly bullish about the prospects of its full self-driving software (FSD), which could transform the company's economics. FSD will power the new Cybercab, a robotaxi that will offer fully autonomous ride-hailing services to earn revenue for Tesla around the clock in the future.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nFive of the Magnificent Seven stocks pay modest dividends\n\nThe Magnificent Seven companies are cash-generating machines. Some of them make so much money that they can't possibly reinvest it all back into their businesses to drive growth, so they return it to shareholders. Some of that money goes toward paying dividends.\n\nApple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Meta Platforms, and Alphabet pay dividends quarterly. However, none of them has a dividend yield of more than 0.75% based on their recent share prices.MSFT Dividend Yield data by YCharts.\n\nYields change regularly for two reasons: First, a company might raise or lower its dividend payment. Second, a stock might rise or fall in value, which would change its yield on paper. It doesn't mean the payout changes in dollar terms, it just changes as a percentage of the current value of your investment.\n\nMicrosoft offers investors the highest yield among the group, and although it may seem small at face value, the company paid out a whopping $21.7 billion in dividends during its last fiscal year (which ended June 30). Because Microsoft has a market capitalization of $3.1 trillion, though, that translates into a relatively small yield.\n\nIf you invested $350,000 in the Magnificent Seven (split equally with $50,000 invested into each stock), you would earn an average dividend yield of 0.37% on $250,000, while earning no yield on the other $100,000 (because Amazon and Tesla don't offer a dividend). That works out to total annual dividend payments across the portfolio of about $925.\n\nThat's a paltry sum even compared to what you could earn in a high-yield savings account with your bank right now. However, it's a nice bonus on top of the incredible capital growth.\n\nHow the Magnificent Seven return more capital to shareholders\n\nDividends aren't the only way for companies to reward shareholders. They can also use stock buybacks, repurchasing their own shares on the open market. This shrinks the number of shares in circulation, which should organically increase the price per share proportionately. In the end, each remaining shareholder effectively owns a larger slice of the company than they did before.\n\nStock buybacks are also flexible. Companies can execute them at times of their choosing, such as when they view their shares as being undervalued.\n\nBecause of those benefits, repurchases make a much larger portion of the capital returned to shareholders in Magnificent Seven stocks than dividends. Five of the Magnificent Seven companies have repurchased stock over the last four quarters, spending a combined $236.9 billion:AAPL Stock Buybacks (TTM) data by YCharts.\n\nAmazon and Tesla haven't been buying back stock lately, but both are profitable, so it might be an option for them in the future. Plus, Amazon repurchased $6 billion worth of stock back in 2022, so it's no stranger to handing some cash back to investors this way.\n\nWith all of that said, the best reason to own the Magnificent Seven stocks is their incredible track record of delivering capital growth. That's likely to continue for the foreseeable future because the AI revolution is still in its early stages, and depending on which Wall Street forecast you rely upon, it could add somewhere between $15.7 trillion (PwC) and $200 trillion (Ark Invest) to the global economy by 2030.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven will play an important role in creating that value, so investors should definitely consider owning these stocks for the long term. Any dividend payments they receive along the way will just be a bonus.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "headline": "With 61% ownership of the shares, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is heavily dominated by institutional owners",
        "content": "Key Insights\n\nGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, Apple's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions 41% of the business is held by the top 25 shareholders Recent sales by insiders\n\nEvery investor in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. With 61% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).\n\nSince institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.\n\nLet's delve deeper into each type of owner of Apple, beginning with the chart below.\n\nView our latest analysis for Apple NasdaqGS:AAPL Ownership Breakdown January 19th 2025\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Apple?\n\nInstitutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.\n\nWe can see that Apple does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Apple, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.NasdaqGS:AAPL Earnings and Revenue Growth January 19th 2025\n\nInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Apple is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 9.0% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 7.3% and 3.9% of the stock.\n\nOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.\n\nWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.\n\nStory Continues\n\nInsider Ownership Of Apple\n\nWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.\n\nI generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.\n\nOur data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Apple Inc. in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$2.1b worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling.\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 37% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nIt's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Apple better, we need to consider many other factors. Take risks for example - Apple has  2 warning signs  we think you should be aware of.\n\nIf you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth, do not miss this freereport on analyst forecasts.\n\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

        "headline": "Warren Buffett Owns 6 Dow Jones Stocks. Here's the Best of the Bunch for Income Investors to Buy Right Now.",
        "content": "Warren Buffett primarily buys large-cap stocks for Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. That makes sense because Berkshire has so much money to deploy that smaller companies simply don't move the needle enough for the giant conglomerate.\n\nBecause of this focus on large-cap stocks, you probably won't be surprised that Buffett owns six stocks that are members of the Dow Jones Industrial Average(DJINDICES: ^DJI). Which is the best pick of the bunch for income investors right now?\n\nBuffett's Dow six-pack\n\nThe two stocks Buffett has owned the longest are both members of the Dow. Buffett initiated a position for Berkshire in Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) in 1988. He bought shares of American Express(NYSE: AXP) in 1991. Both Coke and AmEx are \"forever stocks\" for Buffett. In his letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders last year, he wrote that the two stocks were among a select group he planned to \"maintain indefinitely.\"\n\nHowever, Buffett thinks another Dow stock is \"an even better business\" than Coca-Cola and American Express. He didn't list Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) in the latest shareholder letter as one of the stocks he would own indefinitely. But when asked about the omission by CNBC's Becky Quick at Berkshire's annual shareholder meeting in 2024, Buffett sang Apple's praises.\n\nIt's no coincidence that Apple ranks as Berkshire's largest holding, while AmEx is No. 2 and Coke is No. 4. A Dow stock also holds the No. 5 spot -- Chevron(NYSE: CVX). Buffett began aggressively buying the oil stock in the fourth quarter of 2020 after its steep plunge during the first few months of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nBerkshire doesn't have such large stakes in the other two Dow stocks it owns. Both Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) and Visa(NYSE: V) make up less than 1% of the conglomerate's portfolio.\n\nHow these Dow stocks compare\n\nAmerican Express has been the biggest winner by far over the last 12 months among Buffett's six Dow stocks, with its shares skyrocketing over 70%. Amazon stock has also soared more than 45%. All the others except Coca-Cola have delivered double-digit percentage gains.\n\nDespite its strong performance, American Express' valuation remains more reasonable than most of the others. The financial services giant's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is 20.5, lower than Coke's forward P/E of 21.1 and well below the forward earnings multiples of Visa, Apple, and Amazon. Only Chevron has a lower valuation, with its shares trading at 12.6 times forward earnings.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhat about earnings growth? Amazon is the clear leader. The e-commerce and cloud services leader reported earnings of $15.3 billion in its latest quarterly update, a year-over-year increase of 55%. None of Buffett's other Dow stocks came close to that level of earnings growth in their most recent quarters.\n\nBuffett probably doesn't care what Wall Street thinks about these stocks. In case you were wondering, though, Coca-Cola appears to be analysts' favorite right now. The consensus 12-month price target for Coke reflects an upside potential of 15%. Wall Street is also relatively bullish about Amazon, Apple, and Chevron.\n\nBest of the bunch for income investors\n\nNow, to answer our initial question: Which of Buffett's Dow stocks is the best pick for income investors? There are two main contenders -- Chevron and Coca-Cola.\n\nWe can scratch Amazon off the list, since it doesn't offer a dividend. Apple, American Express, and Visa probably won't appeal to income investors much either with their paltry forward dividend yields of under 1%.\n\nChevron, though, pays a forward dividend yield of 4.05%. The company has increased its dividend for 37 consecutive years. Coca-Cola's yield of 3.1% is lower. However, its track record is even more impressive. The food and beverage maker is a Dividend King, with 62 consecutive dividend increases and counting.\n\nI don't think income investors can go wrong with either Chevron or Coke. However, I think Chevron's higher yield makes it the best of the bunch.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

While the article focuses on income investors and suggests that Apple may not be the best choice for dividends, Buffett's endorsement could lead to increased investor confidence in Apple. The overall bullish sentiment towards large-cap stocks, combined with Apple's strong market position and historical performance, suggests a higher probability of stock price rise. However, the lack of a strong dividend yield may temper some investor enthusiasm, leading to a moderate probability of price decline as well."

                "reasoning": "The news article primarily focuses on Warren Buffett's holdings in Dow Jones stocks and identifies Chevron as the best pick for income investors due to its higher dividend yield. While Apple is mentioned as Berkshire's largest holding and praised by Buffett, the article doesn't explicitly recommend buying Apple. The 'Double Down' advertisement within the article mentions Apple's past performance, but this is a general advertisement and not a direct recommendation based on current news. The article's focus on income investing and the recommendation of Chevron might slightly divert attention from Apple. Therefore, the news is mildly positive for Apple, but not significantly so. The overall market sentiment and other factors will likely have a greater impact on Apple's stock price in the short term."

While the article mentions Buffett's praise for Apple, it doesn't provide any specific new information about Apple's financial performance or future prospects that would directly impact its stock price.  The article's main focus is on income-generating stocks, and while Apple is mentioned favorably, it's not presented as a primary recommendation for income investors due to its low dividend yield. Therefore, the news is unlikely to significantly influence Apple's stock price in either direction. The probability of a price rise or fall is largely attributed to broader market factors and Apple's own performance, not this specific news piece."

Buffett praised Apple during Berkshire's annual meeting, and it remains Berkshire's largest holding. The article also notes that Wall Street is relatively bullish on Apple, with a consensus 12-month price target reflecting upside potential. Given Buffett's influence and the general positive sentiment around Apple in the article, the stock is likely to experience a positive impact. However, the article primarily focuses on income investors, and Apple's dividend yield is under 1%, which might not appeal to this group. Overall, the positive sentiment and Buffett's endorsement outweigh the minor negative aspect of low dividend yield."

Buffett's positive comments about Apple, referring to it as 'an even better business' than Coca-Cola and American Express, are highlighted. However, the article primarily focuses on income investing and recommends Chevron over Coca-Cola for its higher dividend yield. Apple's stock is not specifically endorsed for income investing due to its low dividend yield. Despite this, the overall positive sentiment towards Apple from a prominent investor like Buffett could have a favorable impact on its stock price. The article does not contain negative information about Apple, which suggests that the stock price might not fall significantly due to this news."

The article does not provide any negative news about Apple, but rather highlights its strong performance and Buffett's praise for the company. However, the article's focus on Chevron and Coca-Cola as the best picks for income investors may not have a significant impact on Apple's stock price.

        "headline": "TikTok says 'in the process of restoring service' after going dark in US, citing Trump 'clarity'",
        "content": "TikTok said Sunday afternoon it was in the process of restoring service to its US users after going dark overnight when a new law banning the app took effect at midnight.\n\nIn a post on X Sunday afternoon, TikTok said, \"In agreement with our service providers, TikTok is in the process of restoring service. We thank President Trump for providing the necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties providing TikTok to over 170 million Americans and allowing over 7 million small businesses to thrive.\"\n\nIn a social media post on Sunday, Trump asked tech companies to \"not let TikTok stay dark\" and reiterated his plan to issue a reprieve once he takes office.\n\n\"I will issue an executive order on Monday to extend the period of time before the law\u2019s prohibitions take effect, so that we can make a deal to protect our national security,\u201d Trump posted. \u201cThe order will also confirm that there will be no liability for any company that helped keep TikTok from going dark before my order.\"\n\nTikTok's statement followed roughly two hours later.\n\nBeginning late Saturday, US TikTok users were shown a message saying the app wasn't available, citing the new law.\n\nThe alert also mentioned Trump by name saying, \"We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office.\"\n\nOn its website, TikTok told users they could still login to download their data. As of Sunday afternoon, that message had been updated to read: \"We're working hard to resolve this issue. Thank you for your patience.\"TikTok went dark Saturday night, just ahead of a ban on Sunday. (Source: Yahoo Finance/Dan Howley)\u00b7Howley\n\nStill, many on Capitol Hill \u2014 not to mention outside experts \u2014 questioned whether Trump will have the authority to make good on these promises.\n\nSome of Trump\u2019s closest political allies are also the most outspoken critics of TikTok, and have so far stood by the law that they passed last April with strong bipartisan margins.\n\nIn a statement early Sunday, Republican Sens. Tom Cotton and Pete Ricketts said, \"now that the law has taken effect, there\u2019s no legal basis for any kind of 'extension' of its effective date.\" Cotton added earlier this week on the Senate floor that \"there will be no extension, no concession, and no compromises for TikTok.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, another top Trump ally, also raised questions Sunday, telling NBC he wanted to see the current law enforced and that he is \"really heartened to see that Google and Apple and Microsoft have taken the steps to comply with the law.\"\n\nThe back-and-forth between Trump, TikTok, and US lawmakers will remain in acute relief on Monday, with TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew expected to be in attendance at inauguration events.\n\nRolling shutdown\n\nAccess to TikTok began getting cut off for some US users about 90 minutes before the new law took effect late Saturday. The app was also unavailable via Apple's App Store in the hours leading up to midnight. Videos intermittently loaded on TikTok for a time, but the app also showed a blacked-out screen indicating network issues.\n\nSaturday night's rolling cutoff for US TikTok users followed a report from The Information which said Oracle (ORCL), which manages TikTok's US servers, was set to begin shutting down servers that host TikTok's data as early as 9:00 p.m. ET.\n\nThe law that has resulted in TikTok's shutdown doesn't outright ban the app, but rather it prohibits users from accessing the platform through app stores, like those run by Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and cloud services unless parent company ByteDance sells itself to an owner that is not controlled by a country the US considers adversarial.\n\nCongress has accused ByteDance of having close ties to the Chinese government and alleges that the Chinese Communist Party could force the company to provide it with information on US users or otherwise spread propaganda on the platform.\n\nBut the outcry from users and TikTok's backers forced President Joe Biden and Trump to respond. Even with Trump's assurances Apple and Google that his administration won't enforce the law, it's not guaranteed that his \u2014 or any other administration \u2014 would do so in the future. Each time the companies don't comply with the law they'd have to pay a fine of $5,000 each time a user accesses the social media app.\n\nTrump will have to either convince Congress to overturn the ban or find some other way to work around it if he wants to keep the service up and running, and neither of those is simple.\n\n'It's a good thing for Meta'\n\nShould TikTok's ban eventually come to pass, one of the biggest winners could be one of TikTok\u2019s long-term critics: Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg. In particular, Instagram, owned by Meta, could see a sizable uptick in advertiser dollars if TikTok bites the dust.\n\n\u201cIn general, it\u2019s a good thing for Meta,\u201d William Blair research analyst Ralph Schackart told Yahoo Finance. \u201cWe estimate in a note potentially 60% to 70% of TikTok spend could move to Instagram and it monetizes at around 3x the rate of TikTok.\u201d\n\nSocial media companies have been chasing TikTok\u2019s formula in an attempt to copy the social media platform\u2019s success for some time. Reddit (RDDT), for example, offers its own short-form video feed that could entice former TikTok users looking for a broader kind of social media site complete with various message boards and communities.\n\nSnapchat (SNAP) could also grab users who would have otherwise spent time on TikTok \u2014 and the advertising dollars that follow. But as Morgan Stanley managing director Brian Nowak points out, Snap would have to ensure it can keep those TikTok refugees coming back over and over again \u2014 as TikTok does \u2014 if it hopes to hold onto that ad revenue.\n\nPinterest (PINS) also stands to get a boost if TikTok is forced to go dark. While the app doesn\u2019t have much in common with TikTok as far as overall design, it could offer an opportunity for online retailers looking to drum up e-commerce sales, something TikTok has managed to do thanks to its army of influencers.Sign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter.\u00b7yahoofinance\n\nWith additional reporting from Ben Werschkul.\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

                "reasoning": "The news regarding TikTok's service restoration and Trump's involvement suggests a potential easing of regulatory pressures on tech companies like Apple. However, the uncertainty surrounding the enforcement of the law and the bipartisan support for it indicates that the situation remains volatile. While there may be a slight positive sentiment due to the potential for TikTok to remain operational, the overall market reaction could be cautious given the mixed signals from lawmakers. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a moderate chance of a stock price rise and a significant chance of a fall due to ongoing regulatory concerns."

                "fall_prediction": 0.45,
                "reasoning": "The news regarding TikTok's potential ban and subsequent restoration of service has mixed implications for Apple (AAPL). On one hand, a TikTok ban could benefit Apple indirectly as users and advertisers might shift to platforms accessible through the App Store, potentially increasing Apple's revenue from app sales and in-app purchases. However, the uncertainty surrounding the ban, the political complexities, and the potential for alternative solutions create volatility. The fact that the app was briefly unavailable on the App Store could be seen as a negative, but the restoration of service mitigates this. The overall impact is likely to be slightly positive, but the uncertainty limits the potential upside. The news also highlights the power of political influence on tech companies, which could be seen as a risk factor."

                "reasoning": "The news article discusses the temporary shutdown and subsequent restoration of TikTok in the US due to a new law.  While the initial shutdown might have seemed positive for Apple (as it removed a competitor from the App Store), the subsequent restoration, driven by Trump's intervention, negates this positive impact.  The uncertainty surrounding the future of TikTok in the US, coupled with the legal challenges and political infighting, creates a neutral to slightly negative outlook for Apple.  Apple's direct involvement is limited to hosting TikTok on its App Store; the financial impact of TikTok's presence or absence on Apple's revenue is likely minimal compared to its overall business.  The potential for increased competition from other platforms like Instagram, if TikTok is permanently banned, is also a factor, but this is a long-term effect and not directly related to the immediate news. Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is low, and the probability of a fall is also low, with the most likely scenario being no significant change."

                "reasoning": "The news primarily revolves around the temporary shutdown and subsequent restoration of TikTok services in the US, with implications for Apple Inc. (AAPL) as it operates the App Store. The initial shutdown could have negatively impacted Apple's App Store revenue, but the quick restoration, backed by political assurances, mitigates this risk. However, the ongoing uncertainty around TikTok's future and potential legal battles could create volatility. Apple's stock is less directly impacted compared to social media companies like Meta, but the resolution reduces immediate downside risk. Given the mixed nature of the news, the impact on Apple's stock is likely neutral to slightly positive in the short term."

                "reasoning": "The news about TikTok being restored and the involvement of President Trump and Apple Inc. (AAPL) in resolving the issue could have a positive impact on Apple's stock price. As TikTok was unavailable via Apple's App Store, a resolution that allows TikTok to operate could mean increased usage and engagement with the App Store, potentially driving revenue and positively affecting Apple's stock. However, the uncertainty around the legal basis for Trump's promises and the potential for future complications might temper this positive impact. Given the direct mention of Apple and the App Store in the context of TikTok's availability, there's a reasonable basis to believe that a positive resolution could benefit Apple's stock, though the overall impact might be moderate due to the complexities involved."

This development may have a positive impact on Apple's stock price, as the company's App Store was affected by the ban. However, the long-term implications of the ban and the potential for Congress to overturn it or find alternative solutions create uncertainty. Considering the temporary nature of the shutdown and the potential for a resolution, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising. Additionally, the article mentions that other social media companies like Meta, Snapchat, and Pinterest may benefit from TikTok's potential ban, which could lead to a decrease in Apple's stock price if investors perceive these companies as more attractive alternatives."

This situation could affect Apple as it operates the App Store where TikTok is hosted. While the immediate impact could cause uncertainty, the efforts by tech leaders to restore service could alleviate investor concerns. Additionally, Meta (Facebook) could benefit from increased usage if TikTok is banned, potentially diverting some focus away from Apple."

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Blackrock's 30 Most Important AI Stocks.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, investment titan Blackrock released a commentary on the market outlook for artificial intelligence heading into the closing months of the year, stressing that investors were becoming cautious about the scale of AI spending by tech firms and thus diversifying investments into energy, utilities, real estate, and resources tied to AI infrastructure (for more on this click on 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock). Following this warning, in September 2024, BlackRock, in collaboration with Microsoft, Global Infrastructure Partners, and MGX, announced a new AI partnership aimed at investing in data centers and supporting power infrastructure. This initiative was part of a larger strategy by the investment firm to enhance American competitiveness in AI while meeting the growing need for energy infrastructure to power economic growth.\n\nThe investment giant also expanded product offerings to cater to the growing interest in AI. In October 2024, the firm launched two new exchange-traded funds (ETFs) designed to provide investors with exposure to the burgeoning AI market. These ETFs aimed to capitalize on the increasing demand for AI-driven investment opportunities. Though still in their early stages, the initiatives appear to have paid off. BlackRock reported a net profit of $6.37 billion last year, marking a 16% increase from the previous year. Revenues rose by 14% to $20.4 billion, and assets under management expanded to $11.55 trillion. The firm has attributed a major part of this growth to advancements in AI technologies and projected that AI will be a significant driver of US equities and economic expansion in 2025.\n\nThe BlackRock Investment Institute notes that AI innovations are expected to outpace similar developments in Europe, with private markets playing a crucial role in funding AI-related infrastructure. BlackRock's 2025 Global Outlook suggests that the global economy has moved beyond the traditional boom and bust cycle due to transformative mega forces such as AI technologies, net-zero carbon emission efforts, geopolitical fragmentation, demographic shifts, and the digitization of finance. The firm believes that significant investments, akin to those of the Industrial Revolution, are needed, particularly in infrastructure tied to AI and green technology. The claims made by BlackRock in relation to AI are shared by investment firm JPMorgan.\n\nStory Continues\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nAccording to a recent report on the topic by investment bank JPMorgan, investors should focus on opportunities that will prevail right along the AI value chain instead of focusing on obvious choices. Analysts at the bank have advised investors to weigh future potential earnings against what is already embedded in the price. Per JPMorgan, cheaper valuations and less demanding earnings expectations outside of mega cap tech stocks suggest that even AI bulls should be positioned for further broadening across sectors in 2025. The Investment Outlook 2025 report by JPMorgan takes a look at the soaring valuations of the Magnificent Seven group of stocks and their importance to the AI revolution. The bank highlights that while each of the companies in the Magnificent Seven are geared differently to the AI theme, this group of stocks now make up nearly 35% of the S&P 500 market cap and have driven over 70% of returns since the beginning of 2023.\n\nThis performance, compared against the rest of the market, has allowed for the expansion of valuations. JPMorgan underlines that while the rest of the S&P 500 trades on 12-month forward earnings multiple of 19x, the largest 10 stocks in the index now trade on 29x. Analysts led by Karen Ward, the Chief Market Strategist for EMEA at JPMorgan, contend that the valuation discrepancy between tech and the rest is unsustainable. The report stresses that if the broad AI ecosystem generates sufficient revenues to justify the earnings expectations already assumed for a handful of companies, the rest should catch up over time. It also cautions that if instead, the broader corporate universe does not see the clear use case of these technologies and is unwilling to pay for them, then a catch down scenario is more likely. However, when the strong fundamentals of these mega caps are compared to other parts of the S&P 500 today, as well as to the 2000s tech bubble, a catch down seems unlikely, it notes.\n\nJPMorgan broke down the AI revolution into five key areas. These were identified as AI hardware, AI hyperscalers, AI developers, AI integrators, and AI essentials. JPMorgan has warned that there is a substantial gap between the revenue expectations of hardware companies and the revenue growth that can be generated by the AI ecosystem. The bank has cautioned that this weakness can spread throughout the AI value chain. The report notes that the attention of investors has so far focused on AI hardware and AI hyperscalers, two areas of the AI industry more exposed to the technology and communication services sectors. Per JPMorgan, high levels of valuation dispersion in these categories suggest that opportunities for skilled stock pickers persist, but investors must recognize that any earnings disappointment could lead to substantial volatility.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 12 Best Quantum Computing Stocks To Invest In and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by consulting an investor note from prominent investment firm BlackRock.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. The following factors make Apple a prime investment opportunity. Firstly, the positive financial growth portrays a great picture of the company\u2019s stability that may attract investors. As per the reports of the third quarter of 2024, the firm generated nearly $27 billion in operating cash flow, allowing for a return of over $29 billion to shareholders. Secondly, the company has introduced Apple Intelligence, a personal intelligence system integrated deeply into iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia. This comprises multiple highly capable generative models that are specialized for users\u2019 everyday tasks and can adapt on the fly to their current activities. Moreover, its newly launched iPhone 116 has improved Siri, advanced photo editing, and writing aids. This model also offers free ChatGPT access through a partnership with OpenAI, aiming to transform the smartphone experience with AI advancement. Lastly, the company is dedicated to integrating AI across its product lines, and has invested approximately $20 billion in AI, with an estimated $4 billion invested in 2024 alone.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 6th on our list of Blackrock's most important AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

The partnership with OpenAI and the introduction of Apple Intelligence are also positive catalysts. BlackRock's increased focus on AI and its positive outlook on AI's impact on US equities are supportive. However, JPMorgan's report cautions about the high valuations of the 'Magnificent Seven' (including Apple) and suggests that the broader market may not see the same benefits from AI, potentially leading to a 'catch down' scenario. The article also mentions that some AI stocks may offer higher returns in a shorter timeframe than Apple. The overall sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with potential for growth but also risks associated with high valuations and market expectations. Considering these factors, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a stock price rise than fall, but not overwhelmingly so."

BlackRock's positive outlook on AI's impact on the US economy is a positive factor, but JPMorgan's caution regarding overvalued mega-cap tech stocks and the potential for a 'catch down' scenario introduces uncertainty.  The article's emphasis on other, potentially cheaper, AI stocks suggests that AAPL might be considered relatively overvalued compared to some competitors.  Therefore, while the positive aspects of the news are significant, the overall tone is somewhat tempered by the comparative analysis with other AI investments.  The probability of a price rise is higher due to Apple's strong fundamentals and AI initiatives, but the risk of a price fall is not negligible given the market's overall sentiment towards mega-cap tech valuations."

        "headline": "My 5 Largest Portfolio Holdings Heading Into 2025 -- and the Important Investing Lesson I Learned From Each One",
        "content": "Last year was one for the record books as the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite each hit new record highs at multiple points throughout the year. Furthermore, the bull market continued to gain ground, passing its second anniversary in October, though it's taking a well-deserved breather as we head into 2025.\n\nClosing the door on the old and ringing in the new year is a great time for reflection, and as an avid investor, my first stop is usually my portfolio. One area I like to review is what stocks have emerged as my largest holdings and how they came to dominate my portfolio, as this can provide keen insight for the future.\n\nHere's a look at my five largest holdings heading into 2025 (as of market close on Jan. 13) and an important investing takeaway from each one.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia\n\nFishing, like investing, is rife with tales of \"the one that got away.\" Despite intentions to buy an intriguing stock, life gets in the way, and some development sends the stock soaring, notching gains of 100%, 500%, or even 1,000%. For me, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) was the whopper that got away.\n\nI owned shares of the graphics processing unit (GPU) pioneer early in my investing career but sold them for tax-loss harvesting in 2010. I always intended to buy back into the company, but the stock was underwater for much of the next five years, so I had time. Then, the stock tripled in 2016, taking the wind out of my sails.\n\nHowever, by early 2018, I became intrigued again. Nvidia commanded a 70% share of the discrete desktop GPU market, experienced strong demand for cryptocurrency mining, and was making inroads in the self-driving car market. It was clear that CEO Jensen Huang had a knack for anticipating the next big thing and was adept at positioning Nvidia for success.\n\nAfter much research and even more soul searching -- and despite gains of more than 600% in just over two years and a pricey valuation -- I decided to buy Nvidia. I also added to my position numerous times in the ensuing years. Nvidia quickly became the gold standard when generative artificial intelligence (AI) went viral in early 2023, and my research -- and conviction -- paid off.\n\nSince that purchase in late March 2018, Nvidia has soared 2,200%, and the stock is now my largest holding, amounting to roughly 12% of my portfolio. Simply put, it's never too late to buy into an industry-leading company with a long track record of innovation -- even if the stock has gotten away from you.\n\nNetflix\n\nWhen I first began investing in late 2007, Netflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) was the very first stock I bought. I vividly remember cutting up my Blockbuster membership card after incurring a late fee that was more than the cost of the movie. Netflix conveniently delivered DVDs by mail without the hefty late charges. I was a happy customer, so buying the stock made perfect sense to me.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAt the time, streaming was still in its infancy, but Netflix dominated the DVD-by-mail space, and I was intrigued by its early, consistent market penetration and accelerating expansion. Since then, Netflix has become the undisputed king of streaming, with 283 million subscribers worldwide. The initial shares I purchased in 2007 have soared 34,540% and Netflix is my second-largest holding at 12% of my portfolio.\n\nGains of that magnitude only happened because I held the stock relentlessly, which is much more difficult than it sounds. Some shareholders bailed after the \"Qwikster\" fiasco of 2011, others lost confidence when Netflix lost 1.2 million subscribers in mid-2022, and still others balked at Netflix's foray into advertising. I held the stock through all those challenges and more.\n\nThe company tested investors' mettle many times over the years, but for those who recognized that the investing thesis hadn't changed and stayed the course, the rewards have been life-changing.\n\nMercadoLibre\n\nYou'd be excused if you've never heard of MercadoLibre(NASDAQ: MELI), as it isn't a household name in the U.S. However, from humble beginnings as an online auction platform, it has become the leading technology company in Latin America, providing digital retail and payment services to 18 countries in the region. MercadoLibre provides logistics and shipping services, cross-docking and warehousing, online payments, digital wallets, consumer and merchant financing, and more.\n\nSome investors have avoided the stock thanks to the inherent risks in the region, which include political instability, economic upheaval, and hyperinflation, among others. For example, Argentina, MercadoLibre's home country and one of its largest markets, had an inflation rate that soared 166% year over year in November, and that's just one of the challenges.\n\nYet those risks mask a sizable opportunity. While it's several years behind the U.S. in terms of penetration, its online retail and digital payments adoption rates are among the world's fastest-growing, with a population that's nearly twice that of the U.S. MercadoLibre takes a cut of each transaction hosted on its website, which insulates the company from much of the risk. During the first nine months of 2024, MercadoLibre's revenue grew 38% year over year, driving net income up 55%.\n\nUnderstanding the level of risk and the magnitude of the opportunity, I made the educated decision to buy this \"risky\" stock, a decision that has been extremely profitable. A modest initial investment in 2009 has grown by 7,900%. Combine that with several subsequent investments, and MercadoLibre accounts for roughly 8% of my portfolio.\n\nThis helps illustrate how education can help minimize risk.\n\nApple\n\nDespite numerous challengers over the past couple of years, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) remains the world's most valuable company and one of history's most successful. When the stock surpassed a $1 trillion market cap in 2018 -- and numerous times since then -- some investors believed that the company had reached its apex and there was very little upside from there.\n\nFurthermore, the iPhone is responsible for more than half of Apple's revenue, but as global smartphone penetration has crept higher, sales have begun to slow. Add to that the uncertain economy, and it's easy to understand some investors' misgivings.\n\nYet recent years have illustrated the resilience of Apple's services segment, which generated growth in each of the past four years despite the worst economic downturn in decades. The segment brought in revenue of $96 billion in fiscal 2024 (ended Sept. 30), more than 77% of the companies in the Fortune 500. Furthermore, even as iPhone sales slipped, Apple continued to top the global smartphone market, with the world's three top-selling models and four of the top 10, according to Counterpoint Research.\n\nSelling a stock too soon can be a costly investing mistake, as it certainly would have been with Apple. Since it became a charter member of the $1 trillion club in 2018, the stock has returned 350%, more than three times the 106% return of the S&P 500. Furthermore, since my first purchase in 2008, Apple's stock price has surged 4,120% to become my fourth-largest position, at roughly 8% of my portfolio.\n\nI'm convinced there's more to come.\n\nThe Trade Desk\n\nEvery once in a while, I find myself looking at a stock that has plunged, thinking, \"That can't be right.\" Such was the case with The Trade Desk(NASDAQ: TTD) in early 2020. It had long been among my highest-conviction stocks -- one I had been adding to for several years. The company was a digital advertising powerhouse and continued to gain market share, growing faster then the industry.\n\nImagine my surprise when -- during a four-week period between Feb. 19 and March 18, 2020 -- the stock lost 54% of its value. This wasn't due to any operational failure, malfeasance, or financial impropriety on The Trade Desk's part, but rather marked the start of the global pandemic. However, I had followed the company for years and was quite sure this was an overreaction on the part of investors.\n\nAfter checking to be sure nothing else had changed, I put my money where my mouth was and doubled my position in The Trade Desk. My logic was simple. The need for advertising wasn't going anywhere and the company had a demonstrated track record of using sophisticated algorithms to automate the ad-buying process, ensuring the right ads reached their target market. Furthermore, the stock was selling for half what it was just a month earlier, but the investing thesis hadn't changed.\n\nSince then, the stock has gained 717%, despite enduring the worst economic downturn in decades. Furthermore, since I first purchased The Trade Desk stock in March 2018, the stock has soared 2,349%. As a result, The Trade Desk is my fifth-largest holding heading into 2025, representing 7% of my portfolio.\n\nThe lesson here is a simple one. If the thesis hasn't changed, and a great company is selling at a discount, don't be afraid to buy on the dip.\n\nBonus lesson\n\nIf there's one overriding lesson that pervades this list, it's the compounding power of long-term buy and hold investing.

The article emphasizes the importance of long-term investment and the historical performance of Apple, which has significantly outperformed the S&P 500.

                "reasoning": "The news article is generally positive for Apple. It highlights Apple's resilience, strong performance in its services segment, and continued dominance in the smartphone market. The article emphasizes that selling Apple stock too soon would have been a costly mistake, given its significant returns. While the article acknowledges concerns about slowing iPhone sales and the uncertain economy, it counters these with positive aspects of Apple's business. The mention of Apple being a 'Double Down' stock recommendation in the past, with significant returns, further reinforces a positive outlook. However, the article is not specifically about Apple's future prospects but rather a reflection on past performance and lessons learned. Therefore, the impact on the stock price is likely to be moderately positive, but not dramatically so. The article is more of a general endorsement of long-term investing in strong companies than a specific catalyst for immediate price movement."

The article doesn't contain any new information about Apple's financial performance or future prospects that would significantly impact the stock price.

However, the article does not provide any immediate catalysts or negative indicators that would suggest a short-term price decline.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other must-watch AI stocks on investors\u2019 radar.\n\nWith everyone competing towards supremacy in artificial intelligence, the latest country to intensify its efforts has been Britain. As reported by Reuters, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on Monday, January 13th, that he wanted to make the UK an artificial intelligence \u201csuperpower\u201d. To reach this goal, the Prime Minister has promised to take a pro-innovation approach to regulation, make public data available to researchers, and create zones for data centers.\n\nREAD ALSO: Top 10 AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News and 15 Important AI News and Ratings on Investors\u2019 Radar\n\nStarmer plans to make artificial intelligence a key part of his strategy to boost the economy. According to the government, the technology could improve productivity by 1.5% a year, translating to an extra 47 billion pounds ($57 billion) annually over a decade.\n\n\u201cBritain will be one of the great AI superpowers. We\u2019re going to make the breakthroughs, we\u2019re going to create the wealth, and we\u2019re going to make AI work for everyone in our country\u201d.\n\nAnother country that has been actively striving towards reaching supremacy when it comes to AI has been the US. In its latest efforts, the US government is moving to restrict artificial intelligence chip and technology exports further. Dozens of countries will be facing new restrictions on the export of advanced computer chips and other artificial intelligence (AI) technology. According to officials, the new rules are intended to make sure that \u201cthe world\u2019s AI runs on American rails\u201d and keep it out of the hands of \u201cmalicious actors\u201d who could use it to threaten the United States.\n\nEven though the US government may think it\u2019s heading in the right direction, many top tech companies don\u2019t necessarily agree.\n\n\u201cIn the wrong hands, powerful AI systems have the potential to exacerbate significant national security risks, including by enabling the development of weapons of mass destruction, supporting powerful offensive cyber operations, and aiding human rights abuses, such as mass surveillance\u201d.\n\nChipmaker Nvidia is also against these restrictions and will be the most impacted by the plan. According to the chipmaker, if the restrictions are implemented, they would not \u201cmitigate any threat\u201d but only \u201cweaken America\u2019s global competitiveness\u201d and undermine its innovation.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u201cBy attempting to rig market outcomes and stifle competition\u2014the lifeblood of innovation\u2014the Biden Administration\u2019s new rule threatens to squander America\u2019s hard-won technological advantage\u201d.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Apple Inc (AAPL): AI Innovations Shaping the Future\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that has strengthened its mark in the AI realm with the launch of Apple Intelligence, its personal intelligence system. However, one AI feature on the iPhone has been sparking mistrust and frustration amongst users. The feature, which summarizes user notifications through AI, has been spreading misinformation lately. It falsely claimed that British darts player Luke Littler had won the championship before it happened, also said that Tennis legend Rafael Nadal had come out as gay, and even reported that Luigi Mangione, the man arrested following the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in New York, had shot himself. On January 6, Apple Inc. told CNBC that it was working on an update to resolve the problem. The company said it will be adding a clarification that shows when Apple Intelligence is responsible for the text displayed in the notifications. In more recent developments, BBC reported on January 17 that the company has suspended this new artificial intelligence (AI) feature for now, as it has been drawing criticism and complaints for making repeated mistakes in its news headlines\u2019 summaries.\n\n\u201cWe are working on improvements and will make them available in a future software update\u201d.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of must-watch AI stocks on investors\u2019 radar. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

This negative aspect could outweigh the positive aspects of Apple's overall AI strategy in the short term. The broader discussion of global AI development and regulation, while relevant to the tech sector, doesn't provide specific directional information for Apple's stock price.

        "headline": "Why Is Cliff Asness Bullish On Apple Inc. (AAPL)?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Stocks to Invest in According to Billionaire Cliff Asness.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks recommended by Cliff Asness.\n\nThe founder, managing principal, and chief investment officer of AQR Capital Management, Cliff Asness is a well-known name in the financial industry. Setting off with a $10 million commitment from a small group of investors in 1995, Asness managed to grow the Goldman Sachs Global Alpha Fund's assets to over a $100 million in a matter of months. Distinct even among hedge fund managers, Cliff Asness' investment strategies, focusing on value and momentum strategies, have produced impressive outcomes for AQR Capital over the years. As an example, AQR's flagship Absolute Return fund had a spectacular year in 2022 after declining by over 30% from its peak in 2018. It rose 43.5%, the best performance since launch in 1998. The fund saw a 16.8% increase in 2021, and 18.4% in 2023, making it the best performing multi-strategy fund among its competitors. In its latest 13F filing for Q3 2024, AQR Capital Management disclosed a portfolio value $72.4 billion in 13F securities, with a top 10 holdings concentration of 14.07%.\n\nIn his interview for the book Efficiently Inefficient, Cliff Asness talks about the similarities between judgmental (discretionary) and quantitative investing, stating that both strategies look for cheap stocks with potential catalysts to raise or lower their values. He emphasized how quants use diversification and apply models across thousands of stocks to lower the risk factor, whereas judgmental investors tend to concentrate their holdings, thus relying on in-depth company knowledge. That said, Asness admitted that quant investors do go through periods of underperformance, even with the advantages of thorough data analysis.\n\nBitcoin: Little More Than a Speculative Bubble\n\nAsness has had much to say about Bitcoin over the years. According to the billionaire, the cryptocurrency remains in a speculative bubble after the post-election rally carried it over the $100,000 mark. Speaking on the cryptocurrency on CNBC's Money Movers, Asness stated the following:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m on the bubble side, on net. To move me off that, you really need not a price change, but a use case. That\u2019s what could convince me to become maybe more of a crypto person when I find any use for it, aside from speculation and criminality.\u201d\n\nFollowing a massive year-end surge following president-elect Donald Trump's victory, Bitcoin surged 120% in 2024. With hopes of a national strategic Bitcoin reserve and pro-industry deregulation, investors expected Trump to bring about a golden age of crypto. Although Asness doesn't harbor good prospects for Bitcoin, he stated that he wouldn't short the cryptocurrency either, due to the volatile nature of crypto.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDespite proponents of Bitcoin contending that the cryptocurrency is here to stay and will eventually gain widespread acceptance, Asness' criticisms highlight the absence of real-world applications outside speculative investing. He still views Bitcoin cautiously because he thinks its legitimacy as a store of value and a medium of exchange has not been established. Along with his comments regarding Bitcoin, Asness also expressed his worries about the larger U.S. stock market, stating that high cyclically-adjusted price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratios will cause equities to struggle in the upcoming years. He predicts that during the following ten years, U.S. stocks will probably provide mediocre returns, with just slight outperformance over cash.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the ten best stocks to invest in according to Cliff Asness, we ranked all the stocks part of AQR Capital Managment's Q3 2024 13F SEC filings and picked the fund's top 10 stock holdings. The stocks are sorted in ascending order of AQR Capital Management's stake value.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) The Best NASDAQ Dividend Stock To Buy?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nAQR Capital Management's stake as of Q3: $1.87 billion\n\nGlobal tech behemoth Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is well-known for its flagship devices, which include the iPhone, Mac, and Apple Watch, as well as its extensive network of services, including iCloud and Apple Music. Given that there are about 2.2 billion Apple devices around the globe, the company has a large platform suitable for launching its AI services.\n\nOn January 6, Evercore ISI reaffirmed its Outperform rating on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock, maintaining a price target of $250. Analysts noted that App Store revenue grew by 13% in December, down from November\u2019s 17% growth. However, the App Store's December quarter performance still delivered a 15% growth rate, surpassing Evercore ISI's initial forecasts. This stronger-than-expected showing is anticipated to bolster Apple's overall services revenue, where the App Store and payments from Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) remain key contributors.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) posted a revenue of $94.9 billion, marking a 6% increase compared to the same quarter the previous year. Product revenue reached nearly $70 billion, up from $67 billion in the same period in 2023. Moreover, the company reported an operating cash flow of $27 billion and paid $29 billion to shareholders.\n\nIn its third quarter 2024 investor letter, Madison Investments said the\u00a0following\u00a0regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL):\n\n\u201cAlphabet Inc., Eli Lilly and Company, Qualcomm Incorporated, Microsoft Corporation, and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) were the largest detractors. Apple has been volatile in the last quarter but ended on strength. Early in the quarter, Apple benefited from the introduction of their AI strategy, Apple Intelligence. They followed in September with the new iPhone 16, which also created some excitement. We are underweight to Apple, which has resulted in a headwind for performance.\u201d\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of the stocks recommended by billionaire Cliff Asness. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

The article emphasizes the potential of AI stocks as having greater promise for higher returns, indirectly suggesting that AAPL might not be the best performer in that sector.  While the positive sentiment from Asness's large holding is significant, the counterpoints from Madison Investments and Asness's broader market concerns temper the bullishness.  Therefore, the probability of a price rise is considered moderate, with a higher probability of relatively flat performance or a slight decline given the overall market outlook."

        "headline": "2 Warren Buffett Stocks to Hold Forever",
        "content": "\"When we own portions of outstanding businesses with outstanding managements, our favorite holding period is forever.\"\n\n-- Warren Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway's 1998 Letter to Shareholders\n\nWarren Buffett has created incredible wealth for shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway. It's been very inspiring to individual investors that he did it -- as he alluded to in his 1988 letter to shareholders -- by focusing on investing in quality companies and holding for the long term, without being fazed by occasional market volatility.\n\nHere are two stocks from Berkshire's portfolio that can help you grow your savings for a richer retirement.\n\n1. Apple\n\nBerkshire has held a large position in Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) since 2016. Despite recent sales in the stock, Buffett noted earlier in 2024 that Apple would likely remain Berkshire's largest holding by the end of the year. Indeed, Berkshire still held 300 million shares of the iPhone maker at the end of the third quarter, worth nearly $70 billion in market value. By comparison, Berkshire's next largest stock holding, American Express, was worth $41 billion.\n\nIn 2023, Buffett called Apple better than any business Berkshire owns, and it's easy to see why. Apple has a growing and loyal customer base, with many of the company's customers owning multiple devices. From January 2018 through the start of 2024, Apple's active installed base of devices increased from 1.3 billion to 2.2 billion.\n\nApple continues to attract new customers worldwide. In the most recent quarter, management reported that the active base hit another all-time high across all products and geographies.\n\nThis growth bodes well for the future of Apple's services business, which generates much higher profit margins than sales of hardware products. Apple has been focused on investing to expand the quality and variety of services in recent years, which has led to more than 1 billion paid subscriptions on the company's platform, and this is helping drive record revenue during a slow year for iPhone sales.\n\nApple's revenue grew 2% in fiscal 2024 ending in September to reach $391 billion, mostly driven by a 13% increase in services revenue. The introduction of Apple Intelligence could drive more upgrades, as it only runs on devices with a more recent processor. This remains a key catalyst for improving growth as Apple integrates artificial intelligence (AI) features across its products and services.\n\nThe high margins Apple generates from its products left the company with a massive $93 billion net profit last year. Apple has a lot of resources to reinvest in new products and services to drive long-term growth. The stock has gotten expensive over the past year, but if you start a position and dollar-cost average into it over time, you should earn solid returns.\n\nStory Continues\n\n2. Amazon\n\nBerkshire held 10 million shares of Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) in Q3 and has held a position in the e-commerce and cloud computing leader since 2019. Amazon continues to grow its online retail business, while generating profitable moneymaking opportunities in other services.\n\nAmazon's massive lead in e-commerce, with 6 times the market share of its next closest competitor, positions it well for long-term growth. Recent trends in consumer spending have made it difficult for Amazon to maintain high rates of growth in its online store, but it's still showing a lot of potential. Lower selling prices are attracting more customers, as the growth in paid units accelerated to 12% year over year in Q3.\n\nUltimately, Amazon's advantage centers around its Prime membership program. All of the benefits Amazon continues to stack around Prime, including access to grocery delivery and medical prescriptions through RxPass, make it very difficult for customers to cancel their membership. Amazon said it had more than 200 million Prime members in 2021, but it's still growing. Paid membership growth accelerated in Q3, driving a year-over-year increase in subscription revenue of 11%.\n\nMost impressive about Amazon is its success developing profitable revenue streams outside of its core retail service, such as its cloud computing division (Amazon Web Services). Amazon originally developed its cloud service to support the growth of its online stores, but as it turned out, there was a huge market for this service outside of the company. Amazon Web Services is now generating annual revenue of $103 billion.\n\nThe profitable growth from cloud, and recent efforts to lower costs, helped Amazon bring in $50 billion in net income over the last year. Its continued investment in new fulfillment centers and AI capabilities shows there are still tremendous opportunities to grow and reward Amazon investors for many years.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "headline": "Where Will Apple Stock Be in 5 Years?",
        "content": "In the past five years, the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) has generated a total return of 92% (as of Jan. 14). That's a fantastic gain that's above the historical average.\n\nA strong market backdrop has lifted Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) even further. The tech giant's shares would have more than tripled your money since the middle of January 2020, including dividends.\n\nThe business continues to be a dominant force across the globe. But where will this consumer discretionary stock be five years from now?\n\nHardware is important\n\nApple is known for selling popular hardware devices. The iPhone, which today represents about half of overall sales, even though it's a product in its 16th iteration, still essentially drives financial performance. However, the company has also developed and found smashing success with the MacBook, iPad, AirPods, and Watch.\n\nFive years ago in fiscal 2019, 82% of Apple's total revenue came strictly from products. That's not necessarily a bad thing, as consumers all over the world have grown an affinity to these devices. That's precisely what has made Apple the most valuable brand, according to consultancy Interbrand.\n\nAnd it has supported pricing power. It's crazy to think that people will pay a four-figure sum for a smartphone. Apple has single-handedly redefined the category, and it continues to reap the rewards in the form of massive profits.\n\nA shifting business model\n\nBut Apple's business model is transitioning. In fiscal 2024, 75% of total revenue came from products, with the rest coming from services. The latter segment's dollar amount, however, of $96 billion is 108% higher than five years before, a much faster growth rate than products registered. This segment contains a wide range of money-making activities, including iCloud, advertising, AppleCare, App Store, Apple TV+, Apple Fitness+, Apple Music, Apple Arcade, Apple Pay, and Apple Card.\n\nIt's encouraging to see the company evolve like this. After all, Apple's services, in combination with products, are what make up the powerful ecosystem. It builds customer loyalty and creates a bigger recurring revenue stream over time.\n\nInvestors were worried that Apple would fall behind the artificial intelligence (AI) race. But the business finally launched Apple Intelligence, a suite of AI-related features, late last year. At the end of the day, though, it still matters greatly that this initiative can drive more product sales. This ultimately leads to those devices subscribing to an Apple service.\n\nI believe it's reasonable to assume that services and software will become even more important to Apple's financial success over time, meaning the trend will continue. This is a good thing, as the division carries a gross margin in excess of 70%.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple's return potential\n\nApple shares have jumped nearly 200% in the past five years. This was supported by significantly higher earnings per share (EPS) between fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2024.\n\nHowever, investors must be aware that the valuation has also gotten richer. Apple's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio at this writing is 38.4. Five years ago, in mid-January 2020, the P/E multiple was at 25. The 54% expansion indicates improving market sentiment toward the business. The current P/E ratio has actually rarely been more expensive in the past decade.\n\nApple has a powerful brand thanks to its incredibly popular products and services. And its ability to produce free cash flow is admirable.\n\nBut with fiscal 2024 sales of $391 billion, it's difficult to believe outsized growth is on the horizon, especially since the iPhone is becoming more mature and consumers might not feel the need to upgrade to newer models as often.\n\nWall Street consensus analyst estimates see EPS rising at an annualized clip of 11.4% over the next three years. Assuming that gain continues in the years after that forecast period, coupled with the possibility of the P/E ratio contracting to 30 (still a premium to the market), the stock price is expected to increase just 34% between now and the start of 2030.\n\nTherefore, unless the valuation drops substantially, it's unlikely Apple will generate strong returns over the next five years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

The analyst's projection of a 34% increase in stock price over five years is relatively modest considering Apple's past performance.  This projection is based on assumptions about EPS growth and a contraction in the P/E ratio.  The article also mentions that Apple wasn't included in a list of top 10 stocks for investors to buy now, suggesting a degree of skepticism from at least one analyst group.  Considering these factors, the probability of a price rise is assigned a moderate value, while the probability of a price fall is assigned a lower value, reflecting the overall uncertainty and the potential for continued, albeit slower, growth."

However, the current valuation (P/E ratio of 38.4) is historically high, and the iPhone's maturity may limit future growth.

Given these factors, the probability of a stock price rise is moderate, while the probability of a fall is lower but not negligible due to valuation concerns."

                "reasoning": "The news article discusses Apple's past performance, its current business model transition towards services, and the potential for future growth. While Apple's services segment is growing rapidly and has a high gross margin, the article notes that the stock's valuation has become richer with a P/E ratio of 38.4, up from 25 five years ago. The Wall Street consensus analyst estimates see EPS rising at an annualized clip of 11.4% over the next three years, but the stock price is expected to increase only 34% by the start of 2030. This suggests that the news is neutral to slightly negative, as the expected growth in stock price is not substantial. Therefore, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising and a relatively lower probability of it falling."

While Apple's strong brand, popular products, and services, along with its ability to produce free cash flow, are positives, the maturing iPhone market and rich valuation (with a P/E ratio of 38.4) pose challenges for significant growth. The Wall Street consensus analyst estimates see EPS rising at an annualized clip of 11.4% over the next three years, which, coupled with a possible contraction in the P/E ratio, suggests a modest stock price increase of 34% between now and the start of 2030.

However, the mention of Apple in the context of theatrical releases may suggest competitive dynamics in the streaming and film industry. Given that IMAX's stock rose by over 3% and Netflix's stock also saw a slight increase, there is a positive sentiment in the market. For Apple, the impact is indirect, and while there may be some positive sentiment, it is unlikely to lead to a significant rise or fall in its stock price.

The news is generally positive for IMAX and Netflix, suggesting a potential shift in Netflix's strategy towards theatrical releases, which could be beneficial. However, the direct impact on Apple (AAPL) is minimal. The article simply mentions Apple as a company that already releases movies theatrically. There is no indication that this news will significantly affect Apple's stock price. Therefore, the probability of a rise or fall in Apple's stock price directly due to this news is relatively balanced, with a slight bias towards a neutral outcome. Since the news is about a competitor's deal, it could be interpreted as slightly negative for Apple, but the effect is likely to be small."

        "content": "Synchrony Financial SYF recently made the Pay Later feature of Apple Pay available to eligible Synchrony Preferred Mastercard, Synchrony Plus World Mastercard or Synchrony Premier World Mastercard holders. The specified cardholders now have the flexibility to either utilize their credit card's standard terms or take advantage of a promotional offer featuring fixed monthly payments at checkout.\n\nTo utilize a Synchrony Mastercard with Apple Pay, cardholders must first add their card to Apple Wallet. When making purchases online or in app, using Apple Pay on an iPhone or iPad, customers can select their Synchrony Mastercard. If eligible, they can select the Pay Later option to view available promotional offers. They can then choose their preferred option and complete the fast and convenient checkout process with Apple Pay.\n\nApple Pay offers a secure, private and convenient payment experience for its users. When using a Synchrony Mastercard with Apple Pay, transaction details remain confidential, as Apple does not store any information associated with the user's purchases.\n\nSynchrony plans to extend the option to pay for eligible purchases using fixed monthly payments to a broader range of Apple Pay users within its portfolio of co-branded cards. Later this year, customers will also gain the ability to view and redeem rewards from eligible Synchrony-issued cards while checking out online or in app on iPhone and iPad with Apple Pay.\n\nTherefore, the ulterior motive of Synchrony behind the recent announcement remains to offer a greater level of choice and flexibility to its customers at the time of checkout. The availability of a suitable financing solution that removes the need to make lumpsum payments and does not exert pressure on one\u2019s finances may boost the purchasing power of consumers.\n\nBenefits of the Recent Move to Synchrony\n\nThe facility of providing simplified digital transactions and addressing the diversified credit needs of customers is expected to attract newer customers to Synchrony as well as retain existing ones. Increased utilization of Synchrony\u2019s credit cards may bring growth in interest and fees on loans, from which SYF mainly earns its revenues. Interest and fees on loans advanced 10.5% year over year in the first nine months of 2024.\n\nThe well-earned reputation of SYF can be attributed to its digital and analytics expertise. A series of acquisitions and partnerships, coupled with tech investments, have strengthened the company\u2019s digital arm. This, in turn, has fetched several program agreements with some of the nation\u2019s leading retailers and manufacturers.\n\nStory Continues\n\nSYF\u2019s Share Price Performance & Zacks Rank\n\nShares of Synchrony have gained 89.6% in the past year compared with the industry\u2019s 24.5% growth.

This could lead to higher revenues for Synchrony, positively impacting its stock price. However, since the news primarily concerns Synchrony and not Apple directly, the impact on Apple's stock price may be limited.

This partnership enhances the user experience and potentially increases Apple Pay adoption, which is a positive signal for Apple. However, the direct impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be moderate as Apple Pay is already a well-established service. The news primarily benefits Synchrony Financial. Therefore, while the news is generally positive, the impact on Apple's stock is likely to be limited. I am assigning a slightly higher probability to a rise than a fall, but not significantly so."

While this is positive for SYF, the news is about a *partner* company, not Apple (AAPL) directly.  The impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be indirect and minimal.  The article highlights increased transaction volume and revenue potential for SYF, but doesn't suggest a significant direct revenue boost for Apple.  Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price moving significantly due to this news is low. Any movement is more likely to be influenced by broader market trends or other Apple-specific news rather than this particular partnership announcement."

However, the Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) suggests moderate optimism. The news is more directly beneficial to SYF than Apple (AAPL), but AAPL may see indirect benefits from increased Apple Pay adoption.

This involves difficulties in transferring staff and importing machinery. While this could potentially lead to production delays or increased costs for Apple, the impact is likely to be indirect and relatively small in the grand scheme of Apple's vast and diversified manufacturing and supply chain.  Apple has multiple manufacturing partners and locations.  Therefore, the impact on Apple's overall production and financial performance is expected to be limited. The market's reaction is likely to be muted unless the situation significantly escalates or other negative news emerges concurrently.  The probability of a price drop is therefore considered low, with a higher probability of no significant change or even a slight positive movement due to overall market sentiment or other unrelated positive news."

The article also includes several advertisements for alternative investments, which could subtly detract from Apple's appeal. Overall, the news is mildly positive, suggesting a slightly higher probability of a price rise than a fall, but not overwhelmingly so due to the limited upside potential mentioned and the focus on past performance."

The article mentions a consensus analyst price target of $245.17, representing a modest 4% upside from the current price. This suggests a slightly bullish outlook among analysts, but it's not a strong indicator.  The article also points out that Apple's dividend yield is low (0.43%), which might not attract income-focused investors.  The recent Q4 2024 earnings beat expectations, which is positive, but the overall tone of the article is more retrospective than predictive.  Considering the modest analyst price target and the lack of significant new information driving a strong price change, the probabilities are weighted towards a relatively stable price, with a slightly higher chance of a small increase due to the positive earnings report and analyst sentiment."

Apple is set up to deliver a solid quarter, riding on emerging market growth and steady demand for Services and Wearables. The wildcard is Chinawhile some iPhone weakness has raised eyebrows, analysts see that as a low bar to clear. Plus, with Huawei running into chip supply issues, Apple could quietly scoop up market share. Evercore is sticking with its $250 price target, expecting gross margins to hold steady at 66%-67%.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Sign with HOOD.\n\nBut the real story isn't this quarterit's what's coming next. Evercore sees investors shifting focus to the iPhone 17, which is rumored to bring a major redesign. That, along with the upcoming iPhone SE launch in March, could keep demand strong heading into the back half of the year. While Apple has offered some discounts on iPhone 16 in China, overall demand looks stable, thanks to emerging markets picking up the slack.\n\nWith expectations already tempered, Apple doesn't need to blow the doors off this quarterit just needs to show resilience. A solid print, combined with anticipation for the iPhone 17 and a better-than-feared China update, could be enough to keep the stock moving higher. Investors looking for upside?

The focus is shifting to the iPhone 17, which is rumored to have a major redesign, and the upcoming iPhone SE launch, both of which could boost demand.

The mention of 'asymmetrically interesting' setup further suggests a higher probability of upside. However, the GuruFocus warning signs and the China concerns introduce some uncertainty, preventing a very high probability of a rise.

        "headline": "What could happen to your TikTok app on Jan. 19",
        "content": "What happens on your smartphone once a US law banning the social media app TikTok takes effect on Jan. 19?\n\nIt will depend on the actions of TikTok parent ByteDance, President-elect Donald Trump, and some of the largest tech giants in the US.\n\nByteDance could voluntarily shut down use of the app for US users. Anyone trying to open the app would see a message sending them to a website offering an explanation about the ban, according to reports by Reuters and the Information.\n\nTikTok\u2019s lawyer hinted at this possibility when arguing his case before the Supreme Court, which on Friday upheld a US law that bans the app on Jan. 19 unless it is sold to an owner not controlled by a foreign adversary.\n\nOn Jan. 19 \"at least as I understand it, we go dark. Essentially, the platform shuts down,\" TikTok's lawyer told the court on Jan. 10.The fate of TikTok is now up in the air following a Supreme Court decision to uphold a US ban on Jan. 19 unless the app is sold. (Photo by Anna Barclay/Getty Images)\u00b7Anna Barclay via Getty Images\n\nBut this is not necessarily what is required by law \u2014 a law upheld by the nation\u2019s highest court Friday.\n\nWhat the law signed by President Joe Biden actually states is that it will no longer be legal for companies like Apple (APPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to allow users to download TikTok from their app stores, nor can cloud-storage companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Oracle (ORCL) host the app.\n\nPenalties for violations range up to $5,000 for each access provided to a US user.\n\nIn that scenario the app won\u2019t \"magically disappear\" from phones, CNET tech reporter Abrar Al-Heeti told Yahoo Finance, but experts said its performance could weaken over time because TikTok\u2019s parent won\u2019t be able to make app store updates.\n\n\u201cThe practical effect is, in the short run, what's going to happen is new users won't be able to download the app in any of the marketplaces,\u201d said Pepperdine University media and intellectual property law professor Victoria Schwartz.The law upheld by the Supreme Court requires Apple to take the TikTok app off its app store if TikTok is not divested. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\n\"But I think more significantly, they won't be able to push any updates,\" she said. And that becomes more and more problematic, especially as new operating systems are released.\n\n\"Now, all of a sudden, TikTok is essentially what we call an orphan program. It's super vulnerable to data breaches, to cyber hacking.\"\n\nTikTok's millions of users, especially small business owners, are worried about whether they'll be able to continue to create content on the platform or save their content if the app is shuttered, Schwartz added.\n\n\"In terms of content, under TikTok's licensing agreements, the intellectual property belongs to its content creators,\" Schwartz said.\n\nAccount holders who want to keep their content, she said, should have a plan in place to back it all up. \"It doesn't do any good if you own intellectual property rights and it's stored only somewhere in the TikTok universe.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nIf TikTok does in fact go dark on Jan. 19, it plans to give users an option to download all their data so that they can take a record of their personal information, according to Reuters.\n\nIt could also later restore service for US users if the ban is ever reversed.\n\nWhat Trump could do\n\nFriday's decision likely leaves the fate of TikTok in the hands of President-elect Donald Trump, who promised to \"save TikTok\" and had asked the nation's highest court to suspend the divest-or-be-banned deadline. Trump takes office on Jan. 20.\n\n\"It ultimately goes up to me, so you're going to see what I'm going to do,\" Trump said in an interview with CNN on Friday. \"Congress has given me the decision, so I'll be making the decision.\"\n\nTrump is reportedly mulling unconventional ways to save TikTok from an impending US ban, including an executive order that would push out enforcement of the new law by months.\n\nThe order being considered by Trump, as reported first by the Washington Post and confirmed by other media outlets, would suspend enforcement of the TikTok law for 60 to 90 days.\n\nBut doing so could mean contravening federal law, heightening the danger that such a rescue could face serious legal hurdles.\n\nAny executive order from Trump delaying enforcement of the law would create a new legal dilemma for the tech giants that are required by law to put the TikTok ban into effect.Last November Elon Musk speaks with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump at a viewing of the launch of the sixth test flight of the SpaceX Starship rocket in Brownsville, Texas. Brandon Bell/Pool via REUTERS/File Photo\u00b7Reuters / Reuters\n\nTrump could ask his attorney general not to enforce the law \u2014 his nominee Pam Bondi didn\u2019t commit to enforcing it when questioned by lawmakers this week. But Apple and Google still have to weigh whether that\u2019s a risk they want to take.\n\nThere are less risky paths for Trump to take. He could push Congress to overturn the law or to encourage lawmakers to pass a law extending the Jan. 19 deadline. This week, Sen. Ed Markey did introduce a bill that would extend the deadline by 270 days, according to a statement.\n\nHe could also help find a buyer for the US operations, or even a piece of it, which would allow TikTok to avoid the ban. Chinese government officials, according to reports by Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal, have discussed selling the US business to Elon Musk, the owner of X.\n\nThe officials would prefer to keep TikTok under ByteDance ownership, according to the media reports, but have discussed the sale to Musk as among their contingency plans.\n\nThere are other possible buyers too. Investor and \u201cShark Tank\u201d star Kevin O\u2019Leary told Yahoo Finance last week that he and a consortium of business professionals led by billionaire Frank McCourt Jr. are willing to pay up to $20 billion for TikTok, calling it a \"legacy opportunity.\u201d\n\nTrump said in a post Friday on Truth Social that he had spoken with Chinese President Xi Jinping about TikTok and other topics.\n\n\"It is my expectation that we will solve many problems together, and starting immediately.\"\n\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView Comments",

Additionally, the involvement of political figures like Trump adds further unpredictability.

While Apple isn't directly targeted by the ban, it's affected because it would have to remove TikTok from its app store. This could have a minor negative impact on Apple's app store revenue and user experience, but it's unlikely to be a significant driver of stock price movement. The uncertainty surrounding the ban and potential actions by Trump introduces volatility. A resolution that allows TikTok to remain available would be neutral to slightly positive for Apple, while a ban could be slightly negative. The potential for Trump to intervene and the various possible outcomes make it difficult to predict the stock's movement with high certainty. Given the limited direct impact on Apple's core business, the probabilities are relatively balanced, with a slight lean towards a negative impact due to the uncertainty and potential for negative press."

The ban's impact on Apple is indirect. While Apple is legally obligated to remove TikTok, the direct financial impact is likely minimal.  The potential for negative sentiment stems from the uncertainty surrounding the situation and the potential for negative publicity if Apple is seen as aggressively enforcing a controversial ban. However, the potential for a significant negative impact on Apple's stock price is low, given the relatively small direct impact of losing TikTok from its app store compared to Apple's overall business.  The possibility of Trump intervening to delay or overturn the ban introduces uncertainty, but this uncertainty is unlikely to significantly impact Apple's stock price in either direction.  The overall impact is likely to be muted, with a slight possibility of a temporary dip due to market uncertainty, but a quick recovery is expected."

However, TikTok's removal from the app store does not directly affect Apple's core business significantly, as TikTok is not a major contributor to Apple's revenue. The news might have a minor negative impact on Apple's stock price due to concerns about potential legal and regulatory overhangs for other apps, but the overall effect is expected to be limited.

        "headline": "What could happen to your TikTok app on Sunday",
        "content": "What happens on your smartphone once a US law banning the social media app TikTok takes effect on Sunday?\n\nIt will depend on the actions of TikTok parent ByteDance, President Joe Biden, President-elect Donald Trump, and some of the largest tech giants in the US.\n\nTikTok could voluntarily shut down use of the app for US users, as it threatened to do in a new statement Friday night, even though it is not obligated by law to do so.\n\nIt said \"TikTok will be forced to go dark\" without a \"definitive\" assurance from the Biden administration that the law would not be enforced and the companies that host and distribute the app wouldn't be punished.\n\nThe new warning came after the Supreme Court on Friday upheld a US law that bans the app on Jan. 19 unless it is sold to an owner not controlled by a foreign adversary.\n\nHere is what the law actually requires: It will no longer be legal for companies like Apple (APPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to allow users to download TikTok from their app stores, nor can cloud-storage companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Oracle (ORCL) host the app.\n\nPenalties for violations range up to $5,000 for each access provided to a US user.\n\nThe current White House has said that it will be leaving enforcement of the law to the Trump administration, which takes office mid day Monday, but TikTok said those statements aren't enough to assure service providers like Apple and Google that they won't be breaking the law.\n\nA president can push the Jan. 19 deadline by 90 days if TikTok's parent is making progress on a sale of the US operations.\n\nIf TikTok decides not to go dark and the law stays in place, its app won\u2019t \"magically disappear\" from phones, CNET tech reporter Abrar Al-Heeti told Yahoo Finance.\n\nInstead \"the practical effect is, in the short run, what's going to happen is new users won't be able to download the app in any of the marketplaces,\" added Pepperdine University media and intellectual property law professor Victoria Schwartz.The law upheld by the Supreme Court requires Apple to take the TikTok app off its app store if TikTok is not divested. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nOver time, if the ban stays in place, TikTok's performance could weaken because TikTok\u2019s parent won\u2019t be able to make app store updates. That becomes more and more problematic, especially as new operating systems are released.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\"Now, all of a sudden, TikTok is essentially what we call an orphan program. It's super vulnerable to data breaches, to cyber hacking,\" Schwartz said.\n\nThe immediate worry for TikTok's millions of users, especially small business owners, is whether they'll be able to continue to create content on the platform or save their content if the app is shuttered, Schwartz added.\n\n\"In terms of content, under TikTok's licensing agreements, the intellectual property belongs to its content creators,\" Schwartz said.\n\nAccount holders who want to keep their content, she said, should have a plan in place to back it all up. \"It doesn't do any good if you own intellectual property rights and it's stored only somewhere in the TikTok universe.\"\n\nIf TikTok does in fact go dark on Jan. 19, it plans to give users an option to download all their data so that they can take a record of their personal information, according to Reuters.\n\nIt could also later restore service for US users if the ban is ever reversed.\n\nWhat Trump could do\n\nFriday's decision likely leaves the fate of TikTok in the hands of President-elect Donald Trump, who promised to \"save TikTok\" and had asked the nation's highest court to suspend the divest-or-be-banned deadline. Trump takes office on Jan. 20.\n\n\"It ultimately goes up to me, so you're going to see what I'm going to do,\" Trump said in an interview with CNN on Friday. \"Congress has given me the decision, so I'll be making the decision.\"\n\nOne possible option for Trump under the current law is that he determines that a \"qualified divestiture\" of TikTok's US operations has in fact taken place, a determination that the president has the leeway to make under the new law.\n\n\"Congress explicitly gave the president authority to certify that a [qualified] divestiture has taken place,\" said James Grimmelmann, professor at Cornell Law School.\n\n\"Trump could certify that TikTok has divested, whether it's true or not.\"\n\nBut such a scenario \"requires buy-in from both TikTok and ByteDance, which has said it does not intend to sell,\" added Sarah Kreps, Cornell University professor of government and law.\n\nTrump is reportedly mulling other unconventional ways to save TikTok from the impending US ban, including an executive order that would push out enforcement of the new law by months.\n\nThe order being considered by Trump, as reported first by the Washington Post and confirmed by other media outlets, would suspend enforcement of the TikTok law for 60 to 90 days.\n\nBut doing so could mean contravening federal law, heightening the danger that such a rescue could face serious legal hurdles.Last November Elon Musk speaks with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump at a viewing of the launch of the sixth test flight of the SpaceX Starship rocket in Brownsville, Texas. Brandon Bell/Pool via REUTERS/File Photo\u00b7Reuters / Reuters\n\nAny executive order from Trump delaying enforcement of the law would create a new legal dilemma for the tech giants that are required by law to put the TikTok ban into effect.\n\nTrump could ask his attorney general not to enforce the law \u2014 his nominee Pam Bondi didn\u2019t commit to enforcing it when questioned by lawmakers this week. But Apple and Google still have to weigh whether that\u2019s a risk they want to take.\n\nThere are less risky paths for Trump to take. He could push Congress to overturn the law or to encourage lawmakers to pass a law extending the Jan. 19 deadline. This week, Sen. Ed Markey did introduce a bill that would extend the deadline by 270 days, according to a statement.\n\nHe could also help find a buyer for the US operations, or even a piece of it, which would allow TikTok to avoid the ban. Chinese government officials, according to reports by Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal, have discussed selling the US business to Elon Musk, the owner of X.\n\nThe officials would prefer to keep TikTok under ByteDance ownership, according to the media reports, but have discussed the sale to Musk as among their contingency plans.\n\nThere are other possible buyers too. Investor and \u201cShark Tank\u201d star Kevin O\u2019Leary told Yahoo Finance last week that he and a consortium of business professionals led by billionaire Frank McCourt Jr. are willing to pay up to $20 billion for TikTok, calling it a \"legacy opportunity.\u201d\n\nTrump said in a post Friday on Truth Social that he had spoken with Chinese President Xi Jinping about TikTok and other topics.\n\n\"It is my expectation that we will solve many problems together, and starting immediately.\"\n\nTikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew said Friday that \u201cI want to thank President Trump for his commitment to work with us to find a solution that keeps TikTok available in the United States.\"\n\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView Comments",

While Apple is mentioned as one of the companies that would be required to remove TikTok from its app store, the impact on Apple's overall business is likely to be minimal. Apple's revenue stream is highly diversified, and the removal of TikTok would not significantly affect its earnings. The article highlights several possible outcomes, including a sale of TikTok, a delay in the ban, or TikTok going dark in the US. The uncertainty surrounding the situation could create some short-term volatility, but the overall impact on Apple is expected to be neutral to slightly negative. The negative sentiment stems from the potential disruption to users and the association with a controversial app, but this is balanced by the limited financial impact on Apple. Therefore, the probability of a significant stock price fall is relatively low."

                "reasoning": "The news article discusses the potential ban of TikTok from US app stores on January 19th.  This directly impacts Apple, as the law requires Apple to remove TikTok from its app store if it's not divested from its Chinese parent company.  While the article highlights several potential scenarios, including a presidential intervention or a sale of TikTok's US operations, the immediate risk is the removal of TikTok from the App Store. This could negatively affect Apple's revenue, particularly in the App Store's in-app purchases and advertising revenue generated by TikTok's presence.  However, the probability of a significant negative impact is mitigated by several factors: 1) The uncertainty surrounding the enforcement of the ban, with various possibilities including delays or reversals. 2) TikTok's relatively small contribution to Apple's overall revenue compared to other products and services. 3) The potential for a positive outcome if a sale to a US entity occurs, which could even benefit Apple indirectly.  Therefore, while there's a risk of a short-term negative impact, the overall probability of a significant stock price drop is considered low, with a higher probability of minimal change or even a slight positive movement if the situation resolves favorably."

Trump has expressed interest in saving TikTok, which could mitigate negative impacts on Apple. However, the uncertainty and potential legal risks could create short-term volatility. Overall, the direct impact on Apple's stock is likely neutral to slightly negative in the short term, but the situation is fluid and could change based on political decisions."

This reflects poorly on Apple's AI capabilities and could lead to a slight dip in investor confidence. Given the mixed nature of the news, and the fact that the AI news is a direct negative for Apple, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a stock price fall than rise.

        "headline": "TikTok loses Supreme Court battle to stop US ban",
        "content": "The Supreme Court upheld a US law that bans TikTok on Jan. 19 unless it is sold to an owner not controlled by a foreign adversary, a ruling that creates new uncertainty for a social-media app used by 170 million Americans.\n\nThe court sided with the US government\u2019s argument that ties between TikTok\u2019s parent ByteDance and the Chinese government presented a national security threat that empowered Congress to demand it be sold.\n\n\"There is no doubt that, for more than 170 million Americans, TikTok offers a distinctive and expansive outlet for expression, means of engagement, and source of community,\" the court said.\n\n\"But Congress has determined that divestiture is necessary to address its well-supported national security concerns regarding TikTok\u2019s data collection practices and relationship with a foreign adversary.\"\n\nTikTok had argued that it was entitled to First Amendment speech protections, but the court concluded the law did not violate those constitutional rights for TikTok or its users.TikTok users outside the Supreme Court on Jan. 10. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nFriday's decision likely leaves the fate of TikTok in the hands of President-elect Donald Trump, who promised to \"save TikTok\" and had asked the nation's highest court to suspend the divest-or-be-banned deadline. Trump takes office on Jan. 20.\n\n\"It ultimately goes up to me, so you're going to see what I'm going to do,\" Trump said in an interview with CNN Friday. \"Congress has given me the decision, so I'll be making the decision.\"\n\nTrump is reportedly mulling unconventional ways to save TikTok from an impending US ban, including an executive order that would push out enforcement of the new law by months. He said in a post today on Truth Social that spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping about TikTok and other topics.\n\nThe executive order being considered by Trump, as reported first by the Washington Post and confirmed by other media outlets, would suspend enforcement of the TikTok law for 60 to 90 days.\n\nBut doing so could mean contravening federal law, heightening the danger that such a rescue could face serious legal hurdles.\n\nThe outcome of this blockbuster case will have dramatic implications for one of China\u2019s most valuable technology companies, millions of American smartphone users, and some of the biggest social media companies in the US.\n\nThe court\u2019s decision to uphold the ban could be a long-term boon for TikTok's social media rivals by redistributing advertising dollars to platforms like Meta (META). In particular, Instagram could see a sizable uptick in advertiser dollars if TikTok bites the dust.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg could benefit from a TikTok ban. REUTERS/Manuel Orbegozo\u00b7REUTERS / Reuters\n\n\"In general, it\u2019s a good thing for Meta,\u201d William Blair research analyst Ralph Schackart told Yahoo Finance. \u201cWe estimate in a note potentially 60% to 70% of TikTok spend could move to Instagram and it monetizes at around 3x the rate of TikTok.\"\n\nYouTube and its Shorts platform should also gain from TikTok\u2019s loss. According to Morgan Stanley managing director Brian Nowak, every 10% of the time users would have spent on TikTok that goes to YouTube would add $400 million to $750 million in ad revenue to the video platform\u2019s sales.\n\nWhat happens next\n\nWhat happens on your smartphone now that this US law banning TikTok is set to take effect on Jan. 19? It may depend on what TikTok parent ByteDance decides to do.\n\nIt could voluntarily shut down use of the app for U.S. users. Anyone trying to open the app would see a message sending them to a website offering an explanation about the ban, according to reports by Reuters and The Information.\n\nTikTok\u2019s lawyer hinted at this possibility last week when arguing his case before the Supreme Court.\n\nOn Jan. 19 \"at least as I understand it, we go dark. Essentially, the platform shuts down,\" TikTok's lawyer said.The TikTok app logo. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo\u00b7Reuters / Reuters\n\nBut this is not necessarily what is required by law. A law upheld by the nation\u2019s highest court, which only triggers a ban on Jan. 19 if the app has not been divested, enforces its ban in a different way.\n\nThe law states that it will no longer be legal for companies like Apple (APPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to allow users to download TikTok from their app stores, nor can cloud-storage companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Oracle (ORCL) host the app.\n\nPenalties for violations range up to $5,000 for each access provided to a US user.\n\nAny executive order from Trump delaying enforcement of the law would create a new legal dilemma for these tech giants that are required by law to put the TikTok ban into effect.\n\nTrump could ask his attorney general not to enforce the law \u2014 his nominee Pam Bondi didn\u2019t commit to enforcing it when questioned by lawmakers this week. But Apple and Google still have to weigh whether that\u2019s a risk they want to take.\n\nThere are less risky paths for Trump to take. He could push Congress to overturn the law or to encourage lawmakers to pass a law extending the Jan. 19 deadline. This week, Sen. Ed Markey did introduce a bill that would extend the deadline by 270 days, according to a statement.\n\nHe could also help find a buyer for the US operations, or even a piece of it, which would allow TikTok to avoid the ban. Chinese government officials, according to reports by Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal, have discussed selling the US business to Elon Musk, the owner of X.U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and Elon Musk watch the launch of the sixth test flight of the SpaceX Starship rocket last November in Brownsville, Texas. (Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)\u00b7Brandon Bell via Getty Images\n\nThe officials would prefer to keep TikTok under ByteDance ownership, according to the media reports, but have discussed the sale to Musk as among their contingency plans.\n\nAntitrust experts predict that Musk could clear US legal hurdles imposed by a TikTok acquisition, which some estimate could amount to $40 billion-$50 billion. One reason is TikTok and X have distinct users.\n\nThere are other possible buyers, too. Investor and \u201cShark Tank\u201d star Kevin O\u2019Leary told Yahoo Finance last week that he and a consortium of business professionals led by billionaire Frank McCourt Jr. are willing to pay up to $20 billion for TikTok, calling it a \"legacy opportunity.\u201d\n\nMcCourt, the founder of internet advocacy group Project Liberty and former owner of the LA Dodgers, also recently expressed optimism about a potential deal on Yahoo Finance\u2019s Opening Bid podcast.\n\n\u201cThere's a deal to be made here so that US TikTok can stay in business,\" McCourt said. \"We want to see the platform stay in business and the 170 million [US users] enjoy it.\"\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

While Apple isn't directly involved in the TikTok situation, the ban affects its App Store. The law states that Apple will no longer be able to allow users to download TikTok from its app store. This could be seen as a minor negative for Apple, as it removes a popular app from its platform, potentially reducing app store revenue slightly. However, the impact is likely to be minimal. The article also mentions that any executive order from Trump delaying enforcement of the law would create a new legal dilemma for these tech giants that are required by law to put the TikTok ban into effect. This could create uncertainty for Apple. Overall, the news is slightly negative for Apple, but the impact is not significant enough to cause a major stock price drop. The uncertainty surrounding Trump's potential actions adds a layer of complexity, but the core business of Apple is unlikely to be significantly affected."

The article highlights that if the ban goes into effect on January 19th, Apple and Google will be legally obligated to remove TikTok from their app stores, facing significant penalties for non-compliance. While President-elect Trump could issue an executive order delaying enforcement, this carries legal risks.  The potential for a sale of TikTok's US operations to a US entity remains, which would mitigate the negative impact on Apple. However, the uncertainty surrounding the situation and the potential for legal challenges and financial penalties for Apple if the ban proceeds creates a risk of negative impact on Apple's stock price.  The probability of a stock price rise is lower because the immediate impact is negative, while the probability of a fall is higher due to the potential for legal and financial repercussions for Apple if the ban is enforced. The possibility of a sale of TikTok's US operations lessens the negative impact, but the uncertainty remains a significant factor."

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp. has plowed tens of billions of dollars into artificial intelligence. With its stock struggling, the key question is how quickly those investments can prove to be successful.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThese Homes Withstood the LA Fires. Architects Explain Why NYC Commuters Get New Way to Dodge Traffic: $95 Helicopter Rides Scaramucci, Ackman Donate to Whitney Tilson\u2019s NYC Mayoral Run In a City of Sprawl, Wildfire Evacuation Is Getting Harder Will Americans Ever Lose Their Taste for Telework?\n\nThe worst performer among the Magnificent Seven since hitting a record in July, Microsoft shares have stumbled under the weight of ambitious spending and signs that adoption of its AI services has been slower than hoped. The cooling hype risks leaving the stock vulnerable, given it trades at an elevated multiple.\n\n\u201cThe market is coming to a realization that AI adoption will take longer, and that expectations for near-term returns have gotten out of line,\u201d said Tim Pagliara, chief investment officer at Capwealth Advisors. While \u201cMicrosoft is really pushing AI, it has to prove the concept at a time when it also has huge capex plans and the stock is fully valued by historical standards.\u201d\n\nThe stock is more than 7% below its record high set in July and its gain since the start of 2024 has underperformed that of the Nasdaq 100 Index in that time. The stock rose 1.9% on Friday, participating in a broad-based rally.\n\nThis reflects scrutiny on the firm\u2019s heavy AI-related spending, especially as investors seek a more pronounced payoff. Microsoft\u2019s capital expenditures this fiscal year include tens of billions of dollars on data centers.\n\nThe next read on these trends will come toward the end of the month, when the company delivers second-quarter results. The past two reports have both disappointed, with a tepid growth forecast for its Azure cloud-computing business last quarter and a slowdown in Azure in the previous one.\n\nSlower adoption would further obscure when Microsoft could see a return on its AI investment. \u201cGoogle Gemini, ChatGPT, and Meta AI are significantly more popular among consumers relative to Microsoft Copilot\u201d or other services, according to Wedbush\u2019s quarterly consumer internet survey. It noted that 13% of those surveyed indicated they used Microsoft\u2019s Copilot in the past three months, compared with 25% for Gemini.\n\nMicrosoft has twice rebranded its main chatbot for businesses, as part of an effort to persuade people to use it. Morgan Stanley analysts wrote that this \u201cmight be perceived as a reaction to tepid adoption of the existing paid Microsoft 365 Copilot offering.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nOn Thursday, the company announced a 30% price hike for its suite of Office apps, which come with access to AI tools.\n\nEven if the pace of AI adoption is slower than hoped for, Microsoft remains a consensus favorite on Wall Street. More than 90% of the analysts tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying the stock, and the average analyst price target points to upside of almost 20% over the coming 12 months, the highest return potential among the Magnificent Seven, except for Nvidia Corp.\n\nBank of America expects software will outperform this year, and named Microsoft as one of its top picks, saying it is the \u201cbest positioned\u201d for the AI cycle across infrastructure and applications.\n\nSolita Marcelli, chief investment officer Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, also has a positive outlook.\n\n\u201cWhile AI revenues are likely to again lag behind capex in 2025, we see evidence that AI monetization is primed to improve sharply in 2025,\u201d she wrote earlier this month about big tech stocks. \u201cStrong underlying earnings per share growth should be enough to support solid near-term share price performance.\u201d\n\nRevenue at Microsoft is expected to grow about 14% this fiscal year. Earnings are also seen expanding at a double-digit pace for the next several years.\n\nThe question is whether that\u2019s enough to provide a floor under the valuation. Shares trade at more than 30 times estimated earnings, and while the multiple recently touched its lowest in more than a year, it is above its long-term average of about 25.\n\n\u201cAI adoption is the question on everyone\u2019s mind, but we still find the stock highly attractive given its growth,\u201d said Christopher Ouimet, a portfolio manager at Logan Capital Management. \u201cSome traders are focused on short-term growth trends with AI or Azure, but the long-term picture seems clear. AI adoption might not be linear, but it should end up being massive.\u201d\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nApple Inc. fell 4% on Thursday, the biggest one-day percentage drop for the iPhone maker since August. The stock has come under pressure in 2025 amid concerns over iPhone sales and weakness in the critical Chinese market. Apple is down nearly 8% this year, compared with a gain of 1.9% for the Nasdaq 100. Apple rose 1.3% on Friday.\n\nTop Tech Stories\n\nTikTok is poised to win a reprieve from a law that would ban the popular social media app thanks to a holiday weekend and a pledge from President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s incoming administration to give its Chinese owner more time to divest. SpaceX\u2019s Starship rocket exploded just minutes into its seventh test flight, an unexpected setback after the Elon Musk-led company had made steady progress advancing the vehicle\u2019s capabilities. US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen\u2019s computer was infiltrated and unclassified files were accessed as part of a broader breach of the agency by Chinese state-sponsored hackers, according to two people familiar with the matter. Nintendo Co. fell the most in more than three months after giving a glimpse of its next-generation Switch 2 in a two-minute video, saying that more details would come on April 2.\n\nEarnings Due Friday\n\nNo major earnings expected\n\n--With assistance from Subrat Patnaik.\n\n(Updates to market open.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nWalgreens Replaced Fridge Doors With Smart Screens.

This is because the company's foray into AI has been closely watched, and errors in its AI tool may raise concerns about Apple's ability to deliver reliable and accurate services. However, the impact is likely to be limited as the feature was still in beta and the company is working on improvements.

A 17% annual decline and a 25% drop in Q4, coupled with Huawei and Vivo gaining market share, are strong negative indicators. While Apple is exploring other avenues like new store openings and credit card partnerships, these are unlikely to immediately offset the negative impact of declining iPhone sales in China. The overall sentiment is bearish, suggesting a higher probability of a stock price decrease. The other news items mentioned are either neutral (new store opening) or tangentially related (credit card pact, Alphabet CEO attending inauguration, Meta benefiting from TikTok ban) and do not significantly counter the negative impact of the primary news."

                "reasoning": "The news reports a significant decline in Apple iPhone sales in China across all four quarters of 2024, with a particularly sharp drop of 25% in Q4.  This represents a substantial loss of market share to competitors like Huawei and Vivo. China is a crucial market for Apple, and this negative trend suggests weakening demand for iPhones in a key region. While Apple's overall performance is influenced by many factors beyond China sales, this news is likely to negatively impact investor sentiment.  The magnitude of the decline (17% annually and 25% in Q4) is considerable and warrants concern.  However, it's important to note that Apple is a large and diversified company, and this news might be already priced into the stock, or the market might view it as a temporary setback.  Therefore, while a price drop is more likely, the probability isn't extremely high due to the possibility of the market already anticipating this or other positive factors offsetting the negative impact."

This indicates weakening demand and increased competition from local brands like Huawei and Vivo. Such negative sales performance is likely to concern investors, as China is a major revenue driver for Apple. The market may react negatively to this news, leading to a potential drop in stock price. However, Apple's diversified product portfolio and strong brand loyalty could mitigate some of the negative impact."

GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with TSM.\n\n\"Every step required a permit, and after approval, it took twice as long as in Taiwan,\" Wei said Thursday at a National Taiwan University event. The Biden administration finalized a CHIPS Act deal last year, securing up to $6.6 billion in grants and $5 billion in loans to support TSMC's Arizona expansion.\n\nThe project promised $65 billion in private investment and expected to create thousands of jobs. Wei reassured investors on TSMC's earnings call, saying the Arizona facility matched Taiwan's quality. However, supply chain gaps and a shortage of skilled workers slowed progress.

Apple relies on TSMC for chip production, and any disruption or delay in supply, especially of advanced chips, could affect Apple's product timelines and competitiveness. The GuruFocus warnings regarding TSM add another layer of concern.

While TSMC is a major supplier to Apple, the news doesn't directly impact Apple's operations or financials. The delays in TSMC's Arizona facility might lead to some minor supply chain concerns in the long term, but the statement that Taiwan will receive the most advanced chips first is unlikely to significantly affect Apple's immediate product releases, as Apple likely already has secured sufficient supply of chips for its current product cycle.  The impact on Apple's stock price is therefore expected to be minimal.  The GuruFocus warning signs for TSM are not directly relevant to AAPL's stock price movement.  Therefore, the probability of a price increase or decrease is roughly equal, with a slight bias towards no significant change."

Whether it\u2019s speakers for the home or specialized cameras to document everything from a surfing session to a wedding reception, these businesses are trying to provide innovative, high-quality products that are both useful and cool to own. Adding to the degree of difficulty for these companies is technological change, where the latest smartphone could disintermediate a whole category of consumer electronics. Companies that successfully serve customers and innovate can enjoy high customer loyalty and pricing power, while those that struggle with these may go the way of the VHS tape.\n\nThe 4 consumer electronics stocks we track reported a very strong Q3. As a group, revenues beat analysts\u2019 consensus estimates by 1.8% while next quarter\u2019s revenue guidance was 2.3% below.\n\nIn light of this news, share prices of the companies have held steady as they are up 1.4% on average since the latest earnings results.\n\nPeloton (NASDAQ:PTON)\n\nStarted as a Kickstarter campaign, Peloton (NASDAQ: PTON) is a fitness technology company known for its at-home exercise equipment and interactive online workout classes.\n\nPeloton reported revenues of $585.9 million, down 1.6% year on year. This print exceeded analysts\u2019 expectations by 2.5%. Overall, it was a very strong quarter for the company with EBITDA guidance for next quarter exceeding analysts\u2019 expectations and a solid beat of analysts\u2019 EPS estimates.Peloton Total Revenue\n\nInterestingly, the stock is up 28.8% since reporting and currently trades at $8.56.\n\nIs now the time to buy Peloton?

It currently trades at $1.11.\n\nIs now the time to buy GoPro? Access our full analysis of the earnings results here, it\u2019s free.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWeakest Q3: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nCreator of the iPhone and shepherd of the App Store, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a legendary developer of consumer electronics and software.\n\nApple reported revenues of $94.93 billion, up 6.1% year on year, exceeding analysts\u2019 expectations by 0.5%. It was a satisfactory quarter as it also posted a narrow beat of analysts\u2019 operating income estimates.\n\nInterestingly, the stock is up 1.7% since the results and currently trades at $229.18.\n\nRead our full analysis of Apple\u2019s results here.\n\nSonos (NASDAQ:SONO)\n\nA pioneer in connected home audio systems, Sonos (NASDAQ:SONO) offers a range of premium wireless speakers and sound systems.\n\nSonos reported revenues of $255.4 million, down 16.3% year on year.

The stock is flat since reporting and currently trades at $13.97.\n\nRead our full, actionable report on Sonos here, it\u2019s free.\n\nMarket Update\n\nThanks to the Fed's series of rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has cooled significantly from its post-pandemic highs, drawing closer to the 2% goal. This disinflation has occurred without severely impacting economic growth, suggesting the success of a soft landing. The stock market has thrived in 2024, spurred by recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% each in November and December), and a notable surge followed Donald Trump's presidential election win in November, propelling indices to historic highs. Nonetheless, the outlook for 2025 remains clouded by the pace and magnitude of future rate cuts as well as potential changes in trade policy and corporate taxes once the Trump administration takes over. The path forward is marked by uncertainty.\n\nWant to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals? Check out our Top 6 Stocks and add them to your watchlist.

Despite being labeled as the weakest performer among its peers, the stock has seen a modest increase of 1.7% since the earnings announcement. The overall positive sentiment in the consumer electronics sector, as indicated by the average 1.4% rise in stock prices of peers, suggests a favorable market environment. However, the guidance for the next quarter being below expectations could temper enthusiasm.

The article focuses more on comparing Apple's performance to other consumer electronics companies like Peloton, GoPro, and Sonos. The market update section discusses broader economic factors, including interest rate cuts and the potential impact of the Trump administration, which introduces uncertainty. Given Apple's positive revenue growth and exceeding analyst expectations, there's a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising.

The article highlights that Apple's stock is up 1.7% since the results, which is a positive but modest movement. The broader market context, including recent rate cuts and the impact of the presidential election, is presented as a more significant factor influencing stock market performance than Apple's specific Q3 earnings. Therefore, the probability of a significant price movement (either up or down) solely due to this news is low. The slight positive movement already observed suggests a slightly higher probability of a continued minor rise than a fall."

However, the broader consumer electronics sector showed strong performance, with revenues beating consensus estimates by 1.8%, but next quarter's guidance was 2.3% below expectations.

Apple's revenue increased by 6.1% year over year, exceeding analysts' expectations by 0.5%. The stock price has risen by 1.7% since the results were announced. Considering the positive earnings report and the overall trend of the consumer electronics sector, it is likely that the stock price will continue to rise. However, the article also mentions that the outlook for 2025 remains uncertain due to potential changes in trade policy and corporate taxes, which could impact the stock price. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than the probability of it falling, but not extremely high due to the uncertainty."

        "headline": "Why the tech industry is cozying up to Trump the second time around",
        "content": "When Donald Trump is sworn in as the 47th president of the United States on Monday, some of the biggest names in the tech industry will be cheering on the commander in chief as he returns to the Oval Office.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos and Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg will attend the event, according to NBC News. Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook, who has historically had a good relationship with Trump, will also be at the inauguration, the New York Times reported. They\u2019ll be joined by Trump booster and Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk. Even TikTok CEO Shou Chew, who is hoping Trump will save the social media platform from being effectively shut down in the US, will be on hand, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nBut these executives aren't just taking seats at the inauguration, with many tech leaders among the biggest backers of the president-elect since his win in November.\n\nCook also contributed to Trump\u2019s inauguration, according to Axios, as did Amazon and Meta, with CNBC reporting on contributions from Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT).\n\nNone of this would be particularly out of the ordinary during most inaugural funding announcements.\n\nAfter all, tech companies and executives also donated to Biden\u2019s inaugural committee.\n\nBut Trump has publicly sparred with a number of tech leaders in the past, including Bezos and Zuckerberg, even going as far as threatening to jail the latter.\n\n\"It speaks to two things,\" Deepwater Asset Management managing partner Gene Munster told Yahoo Finance.\n\n\"No. 1 is that tech companies have understood over the past five years that Washington is a bigger X factor in their future, and so there's just a natural willingness to work more closely with the administration.\n\n\u201cThe second is Trump values loyalty, and one way that people kind of express loyalty to him is to give money. And so, for him to take you seriously, you have to get to pay to play.\u201dPresident-elect Donald Trump, Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Vice President-elect JD Vance attend the 125th Army-Navy football game at Northwest Stadium on December 14, 2024 in Landover, Maryland. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)\u00b7Kevin Dietsch via Getty Images\n\nTech\u2019s testy relationship with Trump\n\nBezos and Zuckerberg may have the most to gain by turning around their relationships with Trump. Bezos had a tumultuous relationship with the president-elect during his first term due to the fact that the Amazon chairman also owns the Washington Post.\n\nTrump regularly sparred with Bezos online, tying the Post\u2019s coverage of him to Bezos himself.\n\nIn the lead-up to the election, Bezos made a move to prevent the Post\u2019s editorial board from backing Vice President Kamala Harris for president.\n\nIn defending the decision, Bezos said endorsements create a perception of bias. (Though the paper said at the time it would continue to endorse candidates in local races.)\n\nStory Continues\n\nHundreds of thousands of Post subscribers canceled their subscriptions following Bezos\u2019s decision.Money for something? Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. (Image: Reuters /Manuel Orbegozo)\u00b7REUTERS / Reuters\n\nBezos runs SpaceX rival Blue Origin, and getting on Trump\u2019s good side could mean better opportunities to win government contracts in the years ahead. That\u2019ll be especially important for the company at a time when SpaceX CEO Musk has the president-elect\u2019s ear.\n\nZuckerberg has been on Trump\u2019s bad side for years. Trump called out Zuckerberg during his first term, claiming the Meta CEO was purposely silencing conservative voices on his platforms. Things got worse from there when Zuckerberg suspended Trump\u2019s Facebook account following the Jan. 6, 2020, attack on the Capitol.\n\nAs Trump looked more like he would win the election, Zuckerberg had been transforming himself and his company to win over the president-elect. The CEO has made controversial moves, including killing off its fact-checking program in favor of a community notes style of fact-checking similar to that found on X. Zuckerberg also put an end to the company\u2019s diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts, joining a chorus of executives taking similar actions.\n\nTech goes all in on Trump\n\nBezos and Zuckerberg may be the most noteworthy executives to back Trump, thanks to their prior run-ins, but they aren\u2019t the only ones. And political donations certainly aren\u2019t out of the realm of the ordinary for American companies.\n\n\u201cAll of these executives support whoever is president with monetary donations,\u201d Zeus Kerravala, founder and principal analyst at ZK Research, told Yahoo Finance. \u201cHowever, this administration will be pro-business and these current executives making big donations are ensuring that they have a voice at the table when policies are being made.\u201d\n\nThat includes AI companies like OpenAI, which also donated to Trump\u2019s inauguration effort. The AI industry is rapidly evolving, and tech firms are eager to have Trump\u2019s ear to ensure they have input when it comes to any potential future AI regulations.\n\nIt won\u2019t hurt for Altman to get off on the right foot with Trump, either. Especially since Musk, who is trying to dismantle OpenAI, is already so close to the future president. Apple's Cook, meanwhile, would have the president\u2019s ear to discuss the potential for tariffs and their impact on Apple\u2019s revenue, not to mention the company\u2019s ongoing antitrust issues.\n\nMicrosoft and Google, for their part, could benefit from being in Trump\u2019s good graces at a time when the companies are facing increased scrutiny around mergers and acquisitions. Like Apple, the firms could also seek out assistance when it comes to antitrust matters.\n\nNow tech leaders will need to continue working to ensure their efforts to woo Trump pay off or risk their plans going up in smoke.\n\n\u201cThis is just a reality of navigating the world that's become more political,\u201d Munster added.Sign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter.\u00b7yahoofinance\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "content": "It's no secret anymore. Artificial intelligence (AI) is driving the highest gains in the market, and several of the largest companies in the world today by market cap are only there because of AI. In fact, the five most valuable companies in the world are all making major inroads into AI, and the only one in the top 10 that's not is oil company Saudi Aramco.\n\nIf you're still on the sidelines, you might want to choose at least one AI-driven stock to add to your portfolio. They're not all the risky upstarts you might be imagining. In fact, this list only includes well-established industry giants that mostly have other businesses as well. That gives investors stability in their stock picks as well as exposure to the driving force behind the market's gains today.\n\nThe top five, and the top 10\n\nThe largest companies in the world today by market cap are:\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Saudi Aramco Meta Platforms Tesla Broadcom Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\n\nNearly all of these companies are making strides in developing an AI business. Apple is developing Apple Intelligence, providing its millions of users through its ecosystem with high-level consumer AI services included in its software. Nvidia has up to 95% of the global market for graphics processing units (GPUs), the chips that drive generative AI. Microsoft and Amazon both offer groundbreaking generative AI solutions to cloud computing clients, and Alphabet is turning its Google search service, which has 90% of the overall search market, into an AI-powered solution. That's the future of internet searching.\n\nAs for the last four, Meta and Tesla are both using AI as part of their businesses, rather than creating AI solutions. For example, Meta is using AI as part of its virtual reality business, and Tesla uses AI to power much of the technology it uses in electric vehicles. Broadcom is a major player in the infrastructure that makes AI work, and Taiwan Semiconductor manufactures much of the world's GPUs and other chips.\n\nHere's a visual representation of the top 10 stocks and their recent market cap developments.AMZN Market Cap data by YCharts\n\nWhat about other big companies?\n\nWhat I find fascinating is that as you move past the top 10, the next 10 are almost entirely non-AI companies. On this level, the list consists of:\n\nBerkshire Hathaway Eli Lilly Walmart JPMorgan Chase Visa Tencent Mastercard ExxonMobil United HealthGroup Oracle\n\nWhy investors should pay attention\n\nIt's important to note that the combined market cap of the second tier is about $6 trillion, less than a third of the top tier, which has a combined market cap of more than $19 trillion. The first group isn't just bigger; it's much bigger. And I'll go out on a limb to say that the gap is going to widen this year.\n\nStory Continues\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nThe AI opportunity is simply enormous, and even with the combined tailwinds of moderating inflation and lower interest rates, financial and retail stocks won't be able to catch it. The AI market is expected to increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 27.67% through 2030 according to Statista, and the AI stocks on this list are going to be some of the main beneficiaries.\n\nI'll end with a cautionary note that while investors should definitely pay attention and invest in AI responsibly, they shouldn't put all of their savings into AI stocks. It's at least as important to reduce your risk through diversification, and if you own some solid, reliable value stocks, you can be more confident about putting your growth dollars to work for you with AI stocks.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Therefore, the news is likely to have a moderately positive, but not overwhelmingly significant, impact on Apple's stock price.

With 46 million units and the biggest annual increase among big brands37%Huawei trailed closely. With 42.9 million shipments, a 17% drop from 2023, Apple (AAPL, Financials) came third as domestic flagship smartphone competition grew. With each holding 15% market share, OPPO and HONOR completed the top five.\n\nDriven by government subsidies, year-end promotions, and a robust high-end market, smartphone shipments increased 5% year over year to 77.4 million units in the fourth quarter. With 13.1 million devices sold, Apple kept first but dropped 25% from the same time in 2023. With 12.9 million units each, Huawei and vivo tied for second place, with respectively 24% and 14% increase respectively. With a 29% increase in shipments to 12.2 million devices, Xiaomi (XIACF, Financials) ranked first among major suppliers in Q4.\n\nCiting favorable market circumstances, consistent demand recovery, and government assistance via subsidies launched in January, Canalys expects smartphone sales in Mainland China would top 290 million units in 2025.

This decline in performance, especially in a key market like China, could negatively impact investor sentiment and lead to a decrease in stock price.

The increased competition and the fact that Apple's shipments decreased while others increased significantly points towards a negative impact on Apple's revenue and profitability in the region. Although the overall market is expected to grow in 2025, Apple's ability to regain lost ground is uncertain. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is higher than a rise."

The rise of domestic competitors like Huawei and vivo, fueled by government subsidies and promotions, directly impacts Apple's sales and profitability in a major market. Although the overall market is expected to grow in 2025, Apple's ability to regain lost ground remains uncertain.  The news suggests a weakening position for Apple in China, which is likely to negatively affect investor sentiment. However, it's important to note that this is only one factor influencing Apple's stock price, and other positive factors (e.g., performance in other markets, new product launches) could offset this negative impact to some degree.

Given that China is a significant market for Apple, this negative performance could lead to concerns among investors about Apple's growth prospects in the region.

This could boost investor confidence and potentially drive the stock price up. However, a negative outcome could involve less favorable terms, a more complex integration process, or even reputational risks if Barclays proves to be a less reliable partner.  The uncertainty surrounding the specifics of the deal makes it difficult to definitively predict the impact.

        "content": "Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is taking some serious punches in China. While it held the top spot in Q4 2024 with 13.1 million iPhones shipped, its numbers cratered 25% year over year. Meanwhile, Huawei is on fireposting a jaw-dropping 37% growth in shipments for the year. The broader Chinese smartphone market is back in the green, up 4% in 2024, but Apple is slipping as local players like Xiaomi and OPPO ride a wave of aggressive pricing, foldable innovations, and AI-driven ecosystems. The Chinese government's latest subsidy push could fuel even more competition in 2025, making Apple's fight even tougher.\n\nBut the turbulence doesn't stop in China. Apple is scrambling to find a new credit card partner, with Barclays (NYSE:BCS) and Synchrony Financial (NYSE:SYF) in talks to take over from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). Goldman, once eager to expand into consumer banking, is now pulling back, potentially leaving Apple in transition limbo. A shake-up in its credit card business could ripple into customer spending habitssomething Apple can't afford to mess up as it faces pressure on multiple fronts.\n\nDespite all this, Apple still wears the crown as the world's most valuable company, with a market cap north of $3.5 trillion. But investors are watching closely. Analysts warn that 2025 iPhone shipments could fall 10% below expectations, Trump's potential tariffs could add more uncertainty, and Apple's AI playdubbed Apple Intelligencehas been met with a lukewarm response. Even its hyped Vision Pro headset has barely made a dent in revenue. Sure, Apple has a fortress-like ecosystem and die-hard customer loyalty, but with mounting competition, weak product traction, and strategic pivots underway, the real question is: Can Apple still dominate, or is the empire starting to crack?\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

        "headline": "How a TikTok ban would work - and why user workarounds won't",
        "content": "By Stephen Nellis and Max A. Cherney\n\n(Reuters) - Social media app TikTok, which is owned by China's ByteDance, will be banned in the United States on Sunday unless a deal comes together to sell it to a U.S. investor or the U.S. Supreme Court intervenes.\n\nThe ban results from an April law signed by President Joe Biden and is the first time the United States has attempted to shut down access to an app with such a large user base - roughly 170 million domestic users.\n\nTo pull it off, the law targets a wide swath of U.S.-based partners that help bring TikTok to users, rendering most easy workarounds such as using a virtual private network or changing a phone's country settings moot or difficult to use, experts told Reuters.\n\nAt best, users might be able to access a web-based version of the service that has fewer features than the app, and even that might not work, experts said.\n\nHere's a closer look at how the ban will be implemented.\n\nAPP 'ROTS'\n\nThe law will not force users to delete the app. But TikTok plans to shut down the service and will show users a message about the law and offer to let them download their personal data, Reuters previously reported.\n\nEven if TikTok was not planning a formal shutdown, the app would not work as well as it did before. App store providers are explicitly barred from distributing TikTok to U.S. users, which means that Apple and Alphabet's Google will remove the app from their stores and will no longer distribute updates to fix bugs.\n\nThe TikTok app also relies on a constant flow of new videos, which would become nearly impossible to deliver. TikTok data for U.S. users is hosted and processed on servers owned by Oracle, which most experts believe Oracle would have to cease those operations.\n\nOracle, Apple, Google and TikTok all either declined to comment or did not return requests for comment.\n\nBeyond that, analyses have shown that more than 100 other service providers, such as content delivery networks, help make TikTok operate smoothly.\n\n\"Some subset of that stuff that is required for the app to actually work, both in terms of getting video to you, but also in terms of getting video and content up,\" said Joseph Lorenzo Hall, a distinguished technologist with nonprofit group Internet Society. \"And so uploading might be one of the first things to go. Americans may only be able to watch as their app rots.\"\n\nThe disengagement of those service providers could also affect tens of millions of TikTok users outside the U.S., but company engineers are working to address those issues, sources told Reuters.\n\nStory Continues\n\nTWO PHONES AND A TRIP TO TORONTO?\n\nThe most straightforward workaround to keep access to TikTok would be to use a virtual private network, or VPN, which can conceal the internet protocol, or IP, address of a user and thereby their location.\n\nBut TikTok has other means of knowing where the user is located, such as geolocation data from a phone, said Jason Kelley, director of activism for the Electronic Frontier Foundation.\n\nUsers could try to access a web-based version of TikTok via a browser while using a VPN, but the web version lacks many features of the app and - if the user has to create a new account - would not be as personalized to the user's preferences.\n\n\"It won't be a good service for you, and it won't be a profitable service for them,\" Kelley said.\n\nSome users have discussed steps such as switching an iPhone's country settings to another country in a bid to keep using the app. But that would require cancelling existing app subscriptions and setting up a new payment method for that country, according to Apple documentation.\n\nIt is enough of a hassle that it may be easier to purchase a separate phone dedicated to the app, leading Hall to joke that the law could result in \"Congress forcing the influencer population to carry two phones, just like most of them do.\"\n\nBut even switching an iPhone's settings to a different country is not a straightforward fix. The law bars Apple and other app store providers from delivering the TikTok app to users in the United States regardless of how their devices are configured, so a user would still have to leave the United States to download TikTok.\n\n(Reporting by Stephen Nellis and Max Cherney in San Francisco; additional reporting by David Shepardson in Washington D.C.; editing by Kenneth Li and Nia Williams)",

However, the overall impact on Apple's stock price may be mitigated by its diverse product offerings and strong market position.

While Apple is mentioned in the context of removing the app from its app store and ceasing updates, the direct impact on Apple's revenue and user base is likely to be minimal. Apple's revenue streams are highly diversified, and the absence of TikTok from the app store is unlikely to significantly affect its overall performance. The article mentions that Apple will be barred from delivering the TikTok app to users in the United States regardless of how their devices are configured, so a user would still have to leave the United States to download TikTok. This is a negative impact on Apple, but not a significant one. Therefore, the news is unlikely to cause a significant stock price movement in either direction.

Apple's role is significant as it will be removing TikTok from its app store and will no longer distribute updates. While the direct financial impact on Apple from losing TikTok as a distribution platform might be relatively small compared to its overall revenue, the news highlights Apple's compliance with US government regulations.  The potential for negative sentiment towards Apple is low, as the company is simply complying with a law.  There's no indication of any direct financial loss or penalty for Apple.  Therefore, the probability of a stock price drop is low, and the probability of a price rise or remaining unchanged is higher.  The overall market reaction is likely to be muted."

        "content": "Apple recaptured the top spot in China's smartphone market in the fourth quarter, but it fell to third place in 2024 after a year of escalating competition from domestic players, including a resurgent Huawei Technologies.\n\nThe US tech giant saw smartphone shipments in China plummet 25 per cent to 13.1 million units in the three months through December, down from 17.5 million a year earlier, according to data released by research firm Canalys on Thursday. It narrowly edged out Chinese vendors Vivo and Huawei, which each shipped 12.9 million smartphones, giving all three companies a market share of roughly 17 per cent.\n\nXiaomi and Oppo ranked fourth and fifth in the fourth quarter, shipping 12.2 million and 10.6 million units, respectively.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nHuawei has seen rapid growth in the Chinese smartphone market since the US-sanctioned firm introduced new home-grown chips in 2023. Its shipments were up 24 per cent year on year for the quarter and 37 per cent for the full year. Its shipments reached 46 million units last year, according to Canalys.\n\nFor the full year, Apple was behind Vivo and Huawei in its second-most important market, after reaching the top in 2023. Its shipments fell 17 per cent to 42.9 million units for the year. The iPhone maker made up 15 per cent of the market, while Vivo and Huawei took 17 per cent and 16 per cent, respectively.\n\nChina's smartphone market as a whole saw shipments rise 5 per cent to 77.4 million units in the fourth quarter, and shipments were up 4 per cent for the full year to 285 million units, according to Canalys. It marked a recovery in the region after two years of decline.\n\nRising domestic competition, worsened by US-China tensions that have contributed to patriotic rallying around Huawei, has put pressure on Apple in China as it also faces uncertainty around the launch of its new artificial intelligence service on the mainland. Its shipments in the market were down 25 per cent and 6 per cent year on year in the first and third quarters. In the second quarter, it fell out of the top five.\n\n\"Intense competition has led to a constantly shifting landscape, with vendors actively seeking to expand investments in their advantageous field,\" Canalys research manager Amber Liu said in the report.\n\n\"In addition to driving sales through seasonal promotions, Apple is enhancing its high-end competitiveness and user retention by improving retail experiences through channel management, offering trade-in programmes and expanding coverage of interest-free instalment plans,\" she added.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe company has been offering rare discounts to Chinese consumers to boost sales. Earlier this month, Apple introduced new price cuts for iPhones and other products on its China website and at bricks-and-mortar Apple Store locations to help boost sales on the mainland.\n\nCanalys forecasts smartphone shipments in China will surpass 290 million units this year.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

                "reasoning": "The news indicates that Apple has lost market share in China, falling to third place behind Huawei and Vivo, with a significant drop in shipments. This decline in a key market, coupled with rising competition and the introduction of price cuts to stimulate sales, suggests a challenging environment for Apple. While the company did lead in the fourth quarter, the overall trend for 2024 appears negative. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of it rising."

                "reasoning": "The news presents a mixed picture for Apple. While Apple regained the top spot in China's smartphone market in Q4, the overall trend is concerning. Apple's shipments in China plummeted 25% in Q4 and 17% for the full year, falling behind Vivo and Huawei for the year. This indicates increasing competition from domestic players, particularly Huawei, which is experiencing rapid growth. The article also mentions US-China tensions and uncertainty around Apple's AI service launch in China, adding to the negative sentiment. While Apple is taking measures like offering discounts and improving retail experiences, the strong competition and geopolitical factors suggest a higher likelihood of a stock price decrease. The overall market growth in China is a positive, but Apple is losing market share within that growing market. Therefore, the negative aspects outweigh the positives."

                "reasoning": "Apple's decline in market share in the Chinese smartphone market is a significant negative factor.  While they regained the top spot in Q4 2024, their overall yearly performance shows a substantial drop (17% year-over-year) and a loss of the top spot to Huawei and Vivo. This suggests weakening market position in a key region.  The aggressive price cuts implemented by Apple to stimulate sales further highlight the competitive pressure they face.  However, the overall growth of the Chinese smartphone market and Apple's continued strong performance in the high-end segment offer some mitigating factors.  The news also mentions Apple's efforts to improve retail experiences and user retention, which could help stem the decline.  Considering the mixed signals, the probability of a price fall is higher than a price rise, but the impact is likely to be moderate due to Apple's overall global strength and the potential for future growth."

                "reasoning": "The news highlights mixed performance for Apple in China's smartphone market. While Apple recaptured the top spot in Q4 2024, its annual shipments fell by 17%, dropping it to third place behind Vivo and Huawei. The decline in shipments, particularly the 25% drop in Q4, reflects intense competition from domestic players like Huawei, which saw significant growth. Additionally, Apple faces challenges from US-China tensions and uncertainty around its AI service launch in China. However, Apple is taking measures to boost sales, such as offering discounts and improving retail experiences. The overall Chinese smartphone market is recovering, which could provide some upside. Given the negative annual performance and competitive pressures, the stock is more likely to face downward pressure, but the Q4 recovery and strategic initiatives may mitigate some of the downside."

The company's shipments fell to 13.1 million units, down from 17.5 million a year earlier. Additionally, Apple introduced price cuts to boost sales, which may indicate a struggle to maintain market share and competitiveness.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. projected quarterly sales and capital expenditure ahead of analysts\u2019 estimates, fueling hopes that spending on AI hardware should remain resilient in 2025.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThese Homes Withstood the LA Fires. Architects Explain Why As E-Bikes Boom in NYC, Some Call for More Regulations Chicago Agency Pitches $1.5 Billion Plan to Fix Transit Woes NYPD Reforms Car Chase Policy Amid Rising Crashes, Injuries Churches, Cinemas \u2014 and Moon Artifacts \u2014 Top List of Endangered Monuments\n\nThe main chipmaker to Apple Inc. and Nvidia Corp. foresees spending $38 billion to $42 billion on technology and capacity this year, or up to 19% more than analysts anticipated. It predicted revenue of $25 billion to $25.8 billion in the March quarter, as much as 6% above projections. Shares in TSMC suppliers including Tokyo Electron Ltd. and Advantest Corp. spiked in Asia.\n\nTSMC\u2019s strong performance buoyed optimism around an unprecedented AI spending cycle that drove the likes of Nvidia to new heights. The advent of ChatGPT spurred a frenzied datacenter build-out over the past two years, benefiting a host of companies that provide the piping and brains of the AI boom.\n\nStill, the lack of a big profit-generating AI application so far stoked concerns about a potential bubble. And like much of the industry, TSMC is grappling with uncertainties stemming from a US-China tech conflict that threatens to disrupt supply chains and stem the flow of chips around the world. The US this month announced new export control rules on AI chips to curtail their supply to China.\n\nFollow Chip Giant TSMC\u2019s Quarterly Results in Real Time: TOPLive\n\nAway from AI, TSMC remains heavily reliant on consumer electronics and smartphones, given Apple remains its largest customer. IPhone sales have proven muted, though the industry expects mobile AI features to expand over time, driving the broader market.\n\nOn Thursday, Chief Executive Officer C.C. Wei warned that smartphone unit growth will remain in the low-single-digits in 2025. But he added that there would be mild recovery in segments other than AI.\n\nThe world\u2019s biggest chipmaker reported a better-than-expected 57% rise in net income.\n\n\u201cFor the driver, besides the ongoing robust AI chip demand, there will be support from new smartphone chips and AI PCs, possibly more outsourcing orders from Intel, and WiFi 7 chips,\u201d Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Charles Shum said about the 2025 revenue outlook.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says\n\nTSMC may be able to retain over half of its existing orders from China, following the Biden administration\u2019s restrictions on advanced-chip production for country-exempt chips with fewer than 30 billion transistors, as reported by Bloomberg News. This would allow TSMC to maintain sales of smartphone SoCs and mid-range computing chips for China. Chinese chip orders accounted for 12.6% of TSMC\u2019s revenue in January-September.\n\nStory Continues\n\n- Charles Shum and Steven Tseng, analysts\n\nClick here for the research.\n\nInvestors monitor TSMC\u2019s capex for clues not just to chip and electronics demand, but also on the pace of its international expansion. The 2025 projection given Thursday represented a rise in spending of as much as 40% from 2024.\n\nGeopolitical tensions have pushed TSMC to manufacture abroad. It\u2019s planning more plants in Europe with a focus on the market for artificial intelligence chips, according to a senior Taiwanese official.

                "reasoning": "The news is generally positive for Apple (AAPL). TSMC's (Apple's primary chip supplier) upbeat outlook, driven by strong AI spending and projected revenue growth, suggests continued demand for high-performance chips, which benefits Apple. While smartphone growth is expected to be low, the anticipation of mobile AI features expanding over time is a positive catalyst. However, muted iPhone sales and geopolitical risks (US-China tech conflict) introduce some uncertainty. The positive aspects outweigh the negatives, leading to a higher probability of a stock price increase. The fact that TSMC is investing heavily in AI chip production also suggests that Apple will be able to continue to innovate in the AI space, which is a positive for the company's long-term prospects."

While the smartphone market remains sluggish (with TSMC CEO predicting low single-digit growth in 2025), the robust AI spending outlook is a positive indicator for Apple.  Apple benefits indirectly from this increased AI chip demand as it relies on TSMC for its chips.  However, geopolitical uncertainties and the potential for a slowdown in AI spending remain risks. The overall positive outlook for TSMC, coupled with the expectation of continued, albeit slower, growth in the smartphone market and the emergence of AI-powered features in mobile devices, suggests a higher probability of Apple's stock price rising.  The probability is not 100% due to the existing geopolitical risks and potential for an AI market correction."

TSMC's projected increase in spending on technology and capacity, along with its optimistic revenue forecast, suggests a strong demand for chips which will likely benefit Apple. However, concerns about geopolitical tensions and the lack of a big profit-generating AI application may temper some of the enthusiasm.

                "reasoning": "The news indicates Apple is opening a new store in a new province in China. This expansion into a new market segment within China is generally a positive sign, suggesting growth and increased revenue potential. The store opening also coincides with the Chinese New Year, a period of increased consumer spending.

The news is unlikely to significantly alter investor sentiment or significantly affect the company's overall financial performance.  Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than the probability of a fall, reflecting a small positive impact, but the overall effect is expected to be negligible in the short term."

While the headline doesn't explicitly mention Apple, the context implies that Apple is likely one of these AI stocks, or at least benefits from the overall positive sentiment towards AI.

This increased confidence typically translates to higher demand for the stock, driving the price up. However, the headline is somewhat vague and doesn't explicitly confirm Apple's involvement. There's also the possibility that the market has already priced in this information, or that investors might interpret the news as Berkshire Hathaway diversifying away from other sectors, which could have a slightly negative impact. Given the positive association with Buffett and AI, the probability of a rise is higher, but the lack of explicit confirmation and potential for alternative interpretations temper the enthusiasm."

        "content": "Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is eyeing an early exit from its Apple Card partnership, originally set to run through 2030, signaling a potential shake-up for both companies. CEO David Solomon dropped the news on a recent earnings call, pointing to mounting financial losses and regulatory headaches. Since its 2019 launch, the Apple Card has been a fan favorite for its seamless iOS integration, but it's been a financial drag for Goldman, hammering its Platform Solutions unit with an $859 million net loss in 2024. Toss in a $90 million fine from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau last year, and it's no wonder Goldman is rethinking its commitment.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Signs with GS.\n\nDespite the Apple Card's struggles, Goldman's core businesses are thriving. The firm flexed its muscles in Global Banking & Markets, reporting a jaw-dropping 33% revenue surge in 2024, with strong gains in equity and debt underwriting. CEO David Solomon didn't hold back his optimism, forecasting better returns for Platform Solutions by 2025 or 2026 as the bank trims its focus and dials in on what it does best. Rumor has it that JPMorgan Chase is in the mix as a potential replacement for Apple's next card partner, though no deals are locked in yet.\n\nAs for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), this shake-up could rattle its Apple Card and Savings products, both of which lean heavily on Goldman for backend support. A partner swap might disrupt features like Daily Cash rewards or account management, and interest rate changes could leave users grumbling. But let's not count Apple outits knack for user-first innovation means they'll likely pull off a smooth pivot, keeping customers and their ecosystem intact. Investors should keep an eye on how this plays out, as it could reshape the financial trajectory for both giants.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Discusses Joe Rogan, Elon Musk, And These 13 Stocks.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks.\n\nIn one of his latest appearances on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer started the morning by commenting on the latest Producer Price Index (PPI) release. The PPI, which tracks inflation upstream of the supply chain, rose by 0.2% in December and fell short of economist expectations of 0.3%. However, this didn't lead to any significant reaction in the bond market. According to Cramer, \"Carl these, the bonds just don't want to react to anything good. Of course, we can immediately say, it's because we're gonna get a tough CPI number tomorrow. The fact is, is these numbers are tame. People have to start recognizing that there are some good numbers coming.\"\n\nHe shared other factors that might be fueling the bond market's performance. \"House prices coming down, food coming down, but it doesn't seem to matter,\" Cramer remarked. He added \"What the bonds are reacting to I think is a new administration, uh, concern about what is going to be, uh, tariffs, even though it looks like they're going to be phased in. You know David, interest rates don't wanna come down here. And they don't wanna come down there's too much issuance, there's a belief that the next administration is much more inflationary. And David it doesn't seem to matter what is printed, the bonds don't want to go higher. Interest rate's not low enough.\"\n\nAnother news that has made a lot of headlines recently is TikTok's fate in the US. Cramer believes that rather than a complete bank, there could \"be a gradual diminution of the service. In other words, it's not going to be turned off. I think that this whole idea that the Chinese Communist Party is really just a gigantic private equity firm leaves me cold. I just don't think that they are in a situation to broker a deal.\"\n\nOne person that the CNBC TV show host believes isn't discussed enough is electric vehicle billionaire Elon Musk. \"I mean, Carl, it's so exciting to talk about Elon Musk. I mean we haven't talked about Elon, you know you have to wait maybe to nine o' four to talk about Elon Musk. I just say we do it at the very top,\" believes Cramer. He added \"We have Elon Musk being the most important, well, he's, he's co-president right now which I think is a little absurd.. . . this man has become, Carl, a nation-state within. He's a state within a state.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nOn the topic of markets, Cramer was appreciative of the fact that the market and equal-weighted benchmark S&P indexes are up identically over the last six months \"Well look I, that's good news actually. We want to have broader leadership,\" he remarked. However, without Wall Street's favorite AI stock, Cramer believes \"you have a market that's kind of ruthless. . . David, you know that this market survives on NASDAQ fuel and not on Dow fuel. And yet people still insist on talking about the Dow.\"\n\nFinally, Cramer has also spent quite a bit of time discussing social media CEO Mark Zuckerberg's appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast. This time around, he shared \"I'll go right to Joe Rogan. I'll be five hours in Joe Rogan. One of the most jarring things about the Joe Rogan interview was that he said he had to take a bathroom break. Well, there's professionalism personified.\" Cramer also commented on whether 38% is too much for an interviewer to speak. Taking a mixed view, he stated \"I think it is. I used to put a stopwatch to my show Kudlow & Cramer. I got to speak 38% of the time so you know what, maybe it's not so bad.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired yesterday.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) the Best Safe Dividend Stock for 2025?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the most valuable consumer technology company in the world. The stock's performance in today's AI era has been mixed. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s shares were laggards ahead of the WWDC conference last year, but since the event, they added 29.81% through the year. In 2025, the shares are down by 4.3% year-to-date as investors wonder whether Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) can push AI to consumers through its products and if the iPhone can sustain sales momentum. Cramer, for his part, shared his take on Mark Zuckerberg's comments that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s innovation has slowed:\n\n\"Well, I think when you say that there's been no innovation since Steve, Steve Jobs died, I don't know, I find that inflammatory. But you know what. . . .that was rough, I wanted to go to them and say could you please tell me, I wanted to call them on my Apple devices and use the 72 Apple devices I have [inaudible] and as well as the revenue stream, and talk about how we have now become integrated worldwide with Apple. But you know what let's just stick with Android.\"\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\n\nDisclosure: None.

While Cramer finds this view inflammatory, he also acknowledges the mixed performance of AAPL in the current market context, especially regarding AI and iPhone sales. The overall sentiment appears cautious, with some positive notes about broader market leadership but concerns about inflation and interest rates. Given the mixed signals and the ongoing debate about Apple's innovation, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are relatively balanced, with a slight inclination towards a fall due to the cautious market sentiment."

                "reasoning": "The news article presents a mixed bag for Apple. On one hand, Jim Cramer defends Apple's innovation since Steve Jobs, which could be seen as a positive signal to investors concerned about the company's future growth. However, the article also highlights concerns about Apple's AI capabilities compared to other companies and mentions a year-to-date stock decline. The article also mentions that the author believes other AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. The overall tone is neutral to slightly negative, as the article doesn't strongly advocate for or against investing in Apple. The PPI data and other economic factors discussed are more general market commentary and don't directly impact Apple's stock in isolation. Given these factors, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a stock price fall than rise."

                "reasoning": "The news piece focuses on Jim Cramer's comments regarding Apple's innovation and its position within the broader market context.  Cramer's dismissal of the claim that Apple's innovation has stagnated since Steve Jobs' death is mildly positive for Apple. However, the article also highlights Cramer's preference for AI stocks and suggests that other companies might offer better returns in the short term.  The overall tone is neutral to slightly positive, but the emphasis on AI's potential overshadows the positive sentiment towards Apple. The macroeconomic factors discussed (inflation, bond market behavior) are largely unrelated to Apple's specific performance and therefore have minimal impact on the probability estimations.  The lack of concrete news about Apple itself makes it difficult to assign a high probability to either a rise or fall. Therefore, the probabilities are weighted towards neutrality."

        "headline": "The Best Warren Buffett Stocks to Buy With $1,000 Right Now",
        "content": "Got an extra $1,000 you would like to put to work but don't quite know how? Don't make it complicated. Just poach a pick or two (or several) from one of the world's best-known and most-proven stock pickers. He's Warren Buffett, of course. There's a reason he has been able to reliably lead Berkshire Hathaway to market-beating performances.\n\nWith that as the backdrop, here's a closer look at three of Berkshire's holdings that are solid prospects for you at this time, in no particular order.\n\nCoca-Cola\n\nIt's such a commonly suggested Buffett pick that it has almost become a clich\u00e9. Nevertheless, there's good reason Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) continues to be highlighted as a stock you might want to own, too.\n\nNot only is its namesake cola woven into the world's cultural fabric, but its other well-known brands like Gold Peak tea, Minute Maid juice, Dasani water, and Powerade sports drinks (to name just a few) also mean this beverage behemoth always has something to sell regardless of consumers' ever-changing tastes.\n\nThat doesn't mean things are always easy. Coke shares have fallen 16% from their early September high in response to a small but alarming drop in the total amount of product sold (as measured by volume) during the company's fiscal third quarter of last year.\n\nOperating income and net earnings fell even more during the three-month stretch, with no indication that the headwind was likely to abate during the quarter ending in December.\n\nThis is a timeless business, though, and Coke's brands seem just as timeless. You'll simply need to give this stock enough time for the company to prove it's worth the wait.\n\nBuffett has certainly done so anyway. Berkshire began amassing its current 400 million shares in late 1998. The stock has nearly doubled in value since then, while the dividend -- perhaps the chief reason Buffett's such a fan -- has more than tripled during this time, extending an annual growth streak of 62 years.\n\nNewcomers will be stepping in while the forward-looking dividend yield stands at just under 3.2%.\n\nApple\n\nJust as much as Coca-Cola, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is a frequently suggested Buffett pick. And as with Coke, that's for a good reason. Apple is another one of those timeless stalwarts with a well-deserved reputation for performance.\n\nThat's not necessarily been easy to believe of late. Revenue has been stagnant since mid-2022, while sales of its flagship iPhone (as measured by revenue as well as unit sales) have been just as stagnant for just as long.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAAPL revenue (TTM), data by YCharts; TTM = trailing 12 months.\n\nBuffett and his lieutenants have also been paring back the size of Berkshire's stake in Apple of late, shedding roughly 600 million shares just since early last year. It certainly doesn't seem like a vote of confidence.\n\nJust keep things in perspective. Berkshire Hathaway's position in Apple had grown to enormous proportions -- even by Buffett's liberal standards -- at a time when it looked like unrealized stock gains might become subject to income taxation. He may have simply been thinking strategically.\n\nAnd either way, Berkshire's $70 billion stake in Apple is still its single biggest position, accounting for about one-fourth the value of all the conglomerate's total stock holdings combined.\n\nThe company may be on the cusp of significant and prolonged growth. Near the end of last year, Apple launched an AI-powered tool that is run directly from its newer devices. That is as opposed to being run in the cloud, as most similar platforms like ChatGPT or Alphabet's Gemini typically are at this time. Apple is also developing a processor chip that could power its own artificial intelligence (AI) data centers.\n\nIt's not exactly clear where or what Apple's place in the ever-changing AI arena is. But given IDC's expectation that the worldwide AI platform market will grow at an annual pace of more than 40% through 2028, the company\u00a0isn't wrong to throw its hat into the ring and capture whatever growth it can.\n\nBYD\n\nLastly, add BYD(OTC: BYDD.F) to your list of Warren Buffett stocks to buy with $1,000 right now. If the name doesn't ring a bell, you might be more familiar with it than you realize. The electric vehicle (EV) company has been outselling industry-leader Tesla from time to time since late 2023.\n\nAlthough BYD makes other things, most of its top line comes from its affordable EVs and related products. It's also one of a small handful of foreign stocks that the typically pro-USA Buffett likes, and the only Chinese stock among Berkshire's current holdings.\n\nThis is telling in and of itself -- but not necessarily surprising in light of BYD's past and projected growth. Even in the midst of global economic lethargy (particularly in and around China), this company's top line is expected to grow by 24% for the entirety of 2024, followed by revenue growth of nearly 21% for the fiscal year now underway.\n\nThis pace of growth could persist for a long, long while, too. Although U.S. consumers' euphoria regarding EVs is cooling, actual global demand is still growing and is likely to continue doing so.\n\nBloombergNEF, which tracks the lower-carbon economy, predicts total worldwide sales of EVs are going to nearly double their current levels by 2027, reaching 30 million units, en route to annual sales of 73 million in 2040. As BYD ventures further and further outside of its home turf during this stretch (perhaps eventually including the United States?), look for it to capture at least its fair share of this growth.\n\nAnd don't worry about BYD's over-the-counter listing (as opposed to a more conventional listing on an exchange). With a $100 billion market capitalization, it's not your usual OTC stock.\n\nSecuring U.S. exchange-based stock listings can be a logistical hassle as well as needlessly costly for many foreign companies. It's certainly not a problem for Buffett and Berkshire, which presently hold nearly $2 billion worth of this over-the-counter ticker.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

It is the intersection we call of quality and growth, with an eye on valuations because obviously valuations are very important to investors,\" Chaudhuri explained.\n\nChaudhuri may be ahead of the curve on her call as earnings season unfold.\n\nFactSet estimates that seven sectors from inside the S&P 500 should report fourth quarter earnings growth, and six should have growth in the double-digits. The financials sector is slated to chime in with the highest profit increase in the quarter at 39.5%.\n\n\u201cIf you look at earnings growth expectations, not just for Q4, but in Q1 for financials is where we\u2019re expecting to see some of the strongest earnings growth come through after tech and comp services,\u201d notes Chaudhuri.\n\nFactSet says that double-digit profit growth should also hit information technology, consumer discretionary, healthcare, utilities, and communications services names.\n\nSee more from the Opening Bid podcast\n\nWhy you should buy the 493 other S&P 500 stocks \u2014 and not the Mag 7 Nvidia stock sell-off: Time to back up the truck? Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang: Masayoshi Son is recasting himself into an AI player with his $100 billion bet\n\nIn addition to seeking quality and growth, \u201cwe\u2019re talking about this concept of growth at a reasonable price,\u201d said Chaudhuri. \u201cWe look at strong, healthy balance sheets, low leverage, and companies that are really able to have repetitive earnings growth.\u201d\n\nIn some respects, buying the S&P 500's 493 other stocks at reasonable valuations may be a sort of defensive trade in the current environment.\n\nThe latest jobs report sent stocks on a downward spiral. Headlines abounded detailing how the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost nearly 700 points as wary investors react to potentially fewer Fed rate cuts.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeanwhile, 10-year bond yields creeping toward 5% have rattled investors in the Mag 7 names \u2014a trade that usually works best when yields are below 4%.\n\nRead more: why the bull stampede in stocks may just be starting\n\nYear to date, Mag 7 name Nvidia (NVDA) is down 4%, Amazon (AMZN) is off by 2%, Apple (AAPL) is down 8%, Microsoft (MSFT) is down 2% and Alphabet (GOOGL) has dropped 1%. The lone outperformers are Meta (META) and Tesla (TSLA), likely on fresh efforts by CEOs Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk to curry favor with the incoming Trump administration.\n\n\u201cWe are beginning to see that there can be micro narratives that take hold of the market,\u201d said Chaudhuri. \u201cThey\u2019re going to be more prevalent in 2025. One of the ways we think investors can actually take advantage of that is being a little bit more dynamic in their portfolios.\u201d\n\nThree times each week, Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi fields insight-filled conversations and chats with the biggest names in business and markets on Opening Bid.

While Apple is mentioned as being down 8% year-to-date, the article's main argument is that investors should diversify away from these seven companies and into other sectors showing stronger earnings growth, particularly financials.  The article highlights concerns about higher bond yields impacting tech valuations and suggests that the current market sentiment might be overly negative towards the Mag 7.  While the article doesn't directly predict Apple's price movement, the overall tone suggests a potential for underperformance relative to other sectors.  The emphasis on diversification away from the Mag 7 implies a lower probability of a significant price rise for Apple in the short term, given the current market conditions. However, the article doesn't present a bearish outlook for Apple specifically, only a relative underperformance compared to other sectors."

Apple's stock is already down 8% year-to-date, and the article implies that inflated tech expectations and higher yields may continue to pressure these stocks.

        "headline": "Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Seems To Use Debt Rather Sparingly",
        "content": "David Iben put it well when he said, 'Volatility is not a risk we care about. What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. Importantly, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) does carry debt. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.\n\nWhy Does Debt Bring Risk?\n\nDebt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Apple\n\nWhat Is Apple's Net Debt?\n\nYou can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that Apple had US$106.6b of debt in September 2024, down from US$111.1b, one year before. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$65.2b, its net debt is less, at about US$41.5b.NasdaqGS:AAPL Debt to Equity History January 15th 2025\n\nA Look At Apple's Liabilities\n\nAccording to the last reported balance sheet, Apple had liabilities of US$176.4b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$131.6b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting this, it had US$65.2b in cash and US$66.2b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$176.6b.\n\nOf course, Apple has a titanic market capitalization of US$3.51t, so these liabilities are probably manageable. However, we do think it is worth keeping an eye on its balance sheet strength, as it may change over time. Carrying virtually no net debt, Apple has a very light debt load indeed.\n\nWe use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple has a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of only 0.31. And its EBIT covers its interest expense a whopping 673 times over. So we're pretty relaxed about its super-conservative use of debt. The good news is that Apple has increased its EBIT by 7.8% over twelve months, which should ease any concerns about debt repayment. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Apple can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.\n\nFinally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. During the last three years, Apple generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 90% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect. That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so.\n\nOur View\n\nApple's interest cover suggests it can handle its debt as easily as Cristiano Ronaldo could score a goal against an under 14's goalkeeper. And that's just the beginning of the good news since its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow is also very heartening. Zooming out, Apple seems to use debt quite reasonably; and that gets the nod from us. After all, sensible leverage can boost returns on equity. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. Be aware that  Apple is showing  2 warning signs in our investment analysis, you should know about...\n\nAt the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt.

        "headline": "Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) the Best Safe Dividend Stock for 2025?",
        "content": "We recently published a list of 12 Best Safe Dividend Stocks for 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other best dividend safe stocks for 2025.\n\nThe year 2024 was exceptional for US stocks, with the broader market climbing over 23% and the tech-focused NASDAQ gaining 29%. These impressive results were driven by the \u201cMagnificent 7\u201d group of stocks, which rose nearly 67%, alongside several other large-cap stocks. It marked the second consecutive year of over 20% gains for the broader market, a feat not seen since the late 1990s. Analysts and investors are optimistic about the market\u2019s future, as 2024 demonstrated remarkable strength, suggesting the positive trend could continue. However, despite the current upbeat outlook, investor sentiment could shift quickly due to factors such as global tensions, economic developments, or unforeseen events.\n\nNo matter how the market trends, investors tend to gravitate towards safe stocks that offer stability, particularly during challenging times. Among these secure investment choices, dividend stocks are especially favored. These stocks are typically issued by companies with a reliable history of consistent dividend payments, often from well-established sectors such as utilities, consumer goods, or healthcare.\n\nAlso Read: 10 Best Dividend Kings Stocks to Invest in Now\n\nHistorical analysis consistently shows that dividend stocks tend to outperform other asset classes across various market cycles. A report by T. Rowe Price highlighted that since 1926, dividends have accounted for nearly one-third of the total equity returns for US stocks. From 1980 to 2019, a period marked by a significant decline in interest rates, dividends contributed to 75% of the returns from the broader market.\u00a0 The report further mentioned that dividends become especially valuable in a low-interest-rate environment, offering a steady cash flow when other fixed-income options are less attractive. Once companies start paying dividends, they rarely stop, and most increase their payouts over time. Paying dividends can make a stock more appealing to investors, potentially boosting its value. Over the last decade, dividends for the benchmark index have grown annually, with an average compound growth rate of just over 7%. In strong markets, dividends have enhanced total returns, while in years with low or negative returns, such as 2020 and 2022, dividends played a larger role in total returns, helping to bolster portfolio resilience.\n\nRegarding the safety of dividend stocks, analysts recommend that investors prioritize dividend growth rather than chasing yield traps. Dan Lefkovitz, a strategist with Morningstar\u2019s Index team, stressed the importance of focusing on dividend growth, highlighting that it is a distinct strategy from high-dividend investing. He explained that dividend growth reflects a company\u2019s strong competitive position and positive future prospects. A dividend growth portfolio tends to align more closely with the overall market in terms of sector distribution and growth versus value characteristics, such as price-to-earnings ratios. While it has a value-oriented approach, it is more balanced and core-focused compared to a high-dividend portfolio.\n\nStory Continues\n\nCompanies with a history of consistently raising their dividends have typically outperformed those that don\u2019t pay dividends, all while experiencing less volatility. While dividends are not guaranteed and can fluctuate, especially in the current environment, they have played a substantial role in enhancing overall equity returns over the years. In this list, we will take a look at some of the best safe dividend stocks for 2025.\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nFor this article, we scanned Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds as of Q3 2024 to find stocks with sustainable payout ratios popular among hedge funds. Our focus was on companies that consistently distribute dividends to their shareholders. From this initial selection, we narrowed down the list to include only those companies with a 5-year average payout ratio below 60%, indicating a robust cash position. Subsequently, we identified the top 10 companies meeting these criteria and arranged them in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that held stakes in each of them.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) the Best Safe Dividend Stock for 2025?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\n5-Year Average Payout Ratio: 17.4%\n\nAn American multinational tech giant, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) tops our list of the best dividend stocks. The company has firmly established itself as one of the world\u2019s leading consumer brands and a pioneer in technology innovation. Known for its high-quality products, the company\u2019s premium lineup\u2014including the flagship iPhone, Mac computers, and a growing range of wearables and accessories\u2014has earned widespread acclaim and strong customer loyalty. The stock has surged by over 28% in the past 12 months.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported revenue of $94.9 billion, which saw a 6% growth from the same period last year. The Products revenue came in at nearly $70 billion, up from $67 billion in the prior-year period. With over 2.2 billion active Apple devices globally, Apple Intelligence is poised to bring AI capabilities to a vast audience through a user-friendly interface. The company is expected to gain from heightened interest in new technology, sparking a refresh cycle, as well as from a stable macroeconomic environment.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) also reported a strong cash position in the most recent quarter. The company\u2019s operating cash flow came in at $27 billion and it returned $29 billion to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases. It pays a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share and has a dividend yield of 0.42%, as recorded on January 13.\n\nParnassus Investments mentioned AAPL in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares rose during the quarter, making our underweight position a relative detractor. Investors reacted positively to the new iPhone 16 lineup and its advanced features, including generative artificial intelligence, greater durability and increased processing power.\u201d\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) was included in 158 hedge fund portfolios at the end of Q3 2024, according to Insider Monkey\u2019s database. The stakes held by these funds are worth nearly $110 billion.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 1st on our list of best dividend safe stocks for 2025. While we acknowledge the potential for AAPL to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other important AI news and ratings on investors\u2019 radar.\n\nOn Monday, the US government revealed that it would further restrict artificial intelligence chip and technology exports. As reported by Reuters, the goal behind these restrictions is to help the US advance its computing power and AI technology, while finding more ways to block China\u2019s access. Under the new regulations, the number of AI chips exported to most countries will be capped, allowing unlimited access to U.S. AI technology for America\u2019s closest allies. Meanwhile, a block shall be maintained on exports to China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. leads AI now \u2013 both AI development and AI chip design, and it\u2019s critical that we keep it that way\u201d.\n\nREAD NOW:\u00a0Top 10 AI Stocks on Wall Street\u2019s Radar and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings\n\nThese regulations are seemingly the last efforts by the Biden administration to maintain US leadership in AI and close any loopholes in controlling the flow of AI chips. The new administration, set to take office on January 20, shares similar views on the competitive threat from China. However, President-elect Donald Trump is expected to make significant changes to the Biden administration\u2019s stance on artificial intelligence.\n\n\u201cWe will repeal Joe Biden\u2019s dangerous Executive Order that hinders AI innovation, and imposes radical leftwing ideas on the development of this technology. In its place, Republicans support AI development rooted in free speech and human flourishing\u201d.\n\nWith only a few days left until Trump takes office, the recently revealed restrictions on AI chips have been imposed on advanced graphics processing units (GPUs), which are used to power data centers needed to train AI models. Moreover, under the new rules, cloud providers will be able to build data centers by applying for global approval. Once approved, they won\u2019t need export licenses for AI chips which will allow them to build data centers in countries that cannot import enough chips because of the U.S.-imposed quotas. However, these authorized companies must abide by stringent conditions and restrictions, such as security requirements, reporting demands, and a plan or track record of respecting human rights.\n\nCurrently, the recent regulation divides the world into three tiers. 18 countries, including Japan, Britain, South Korea, and the Netherlands, will essentially be exempt from the rules. Moreover, 120 other countries, including Singapore, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, will face country caps, whereas arms-embargoed countries like Russia, China, and Iran will not be allowed to receive the technology altogether.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u201cHow effective the rule ends up being in the next 10 to 15 years is now up to the incoming team. They are well aware that ensuring a dominant domestic industry is a core element of competition with China\u201d.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company. Recently, the company has had underwhelming upgrades and competitors that have led the iPhone maker to lose market share in the final quarter of 2024. Bloomberg cited research by Counterpoint Research data, stating how the iPhone\u2019s market share slipped a point to 18% worldwide in 2024. As per the research, the company marked a 2% sales decline for the full year, while the wider market grew 4% globally.\n\nOn the other hand, Android device makers from China, led by Xiaomi Corp. and Vivo, have been gaining strength in the region. Since Apple\u2019s new artificial intelligence suite isn\u2019t available in China, the lack of AI availability has hindered its performance in the region. The company is currently striving to partner up with local players to provide features such as AI writing assistance and image generation. Nevertheless, Apple\u2019s AI hasn\u2019t been all the rage, either.\n\n\u201cApple\u2019s iPhone 16 series was met with a mixed response, partly due to a lack of availability of Apple Intelligence at launch. However, Apple continued to grow strongly in its noncore markets like Latin America\u201d.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of important AI news and ratings on investors\u2019 radar.

Those processors are being quality verified in the batch of initial processors to be sure they're providing the same quality as TSMC's highest-end chips coming out of Taiwan, Nikkei Asia said. Apple's first major customer for the fab is expected to begin mass production as early as Q1 2025 if testing does not experience any setbacks.\n\nIt is a big step forward for the United States on its journey toward semiconductor independence by cutting reliance on Taiwan a region susceptible to geopolitical tensions with Beijing and natural disaster risks. The Arizona fab is a key move to strengthen U.S. semiconductor supply chains as competition in the industry heats up globally.\n\nThe Arizona facility has led the transition, but other tech giants, such as AMD (AMD, Financial) and Nvidia (NVDA, Financial), are doing test production there, indicating a possible use of locally produced chips. For now, chips manufactured in Arizona are being shipped back to Amkor in Taiwan for packaging until a new facility in Peoria, Arizona, is complete.\n\nLCY Chemical, a supplier now aligned close to an Arizona fab, which had its deployment delayed by about a year due to logistical challenges, is one of those. However, the project highlights the U.S. semiconductor industry's new tide of reshoring critical manufacturing capabilities despite these hurdles.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

This could enhance Apple's supply chain stability and potentially lead to cost savings in the long run. The positive implications for U.S. semiconductor independence and the strengthening of local supply chains are likely to be viewed favorably by investors. However, the timeline for mass production is set for Q1 2025, which means immediate impacts on stock price may be limited. Overall, the sentiment around this news is positive, suggesting a higher probability of stock price increase."

                "reasoning": "The news is generally positive for Apple. While the direct impact of using TSMC's Arizona fab might be neutral in terms of chip performance (as the goal is to match Taiwan quality), the strategic implications are favorable. Diversifying supply chains away from Taiwan reduces geopolitical risk and potential disruptions, which investors generally view positively. The 'Made in America' aspect could also resonate with some consumers and government entities, potentially boosting demand in the long run. However, the news also mentions logistical challenges and delays faced by suppliers, which could temper enthusiasm. The fact that other companies like AMD and Nvidia are also testing the facility suggests a broader positive trend for the US semiconductor industry, but the immediate impact is primarily on Apple as the first major customer. Given these factors, a slight positive movement is more likely than a negative one, but the logistical challenges and the fact that this is a Q1 2025 event limit the immediate impact."

                "reasoning": "The news that Apple will begin using chips manufactured at TSMC's Arizona fab in Q1 2025 is generally positive for Apple.  Reducing reliance on Taiwan for chip production mitigates geopolitical and natural disaster risks, enhancing supply chain security. This is a long-term positive, but the immediate impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be muted.  The news confirms a previously anticipated event, and the timeline is relatively far out. While it showcases Apple's commitment to diversification and potentially future cost savings, the short-term effects on profitability or product releases are minimal.  There's a possibility of negative sentiment if initial testing reveals quality issues, but this is considered unlikely given the rigorous testing mentioned in the article. The overall impact is likely to be a slight positive, but not a significant driver of immediate stock price movement."

        "headline": "Should You Buy Stock in the Largest Company in the World?",
        "content": "The world's biggest companies have proved themselves over time, generating earnings growth and stock performance. They've built rock-solid businesses, demonstrated they can prevail even in competitive industries, and generally these points should set them up for future success too. And, according to Motley Fool research, all but one of these companies has delivered five-year annualized returns in the double digits. So investors who have bought these players and held on for the long term have scored a win.\n\nToday, about half of the 20 largest companies are in the technology field, specializing in everything from artificial intelligence (AI) chips to social media and smartphones. And speaking of smartphones, the company that tops the list as the biggest by market value is iPhone maker Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). The tech giant was worth $3.68 trillion as of Jan. 6, a step ahead of the $3.54 trillion Nvidia. And Apple also is the first company ever to reach market cap levels of $1 trillion, $2 trillion, and $3 trillion.\n\nFounded in 1976, Apple has come a long way, building a consumer electronics and services empire that generates billions of dollars in earnings annually -- and the stock has soared more than 184,000% since its market debut in 1980. Now the question is: Should you buy stock in Apple, or is it too late to get in on this market powerhouse? Let's find out.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nA strong competitive advantage\n\nSo, first, a little bit of background on Apple. I probably don't have to tell you that the company is maker of some of today's best-known consumer products, from the iPhone as I mentioned, to the Mac and iPad. What's kept Apple ahead is its innovation and ability to keep users loyal to its products -- they'll wait for the latest iPhone release, for example, and won't opt for lower-priced rivals. This moat, or competitive advantage, has played a key role in Apple's earnings growth over time.\n\nApple's gross profit on a trailing-12-month basis totals more than $180 billion, and revenue tops $390 billion.AAPL Gross Profit (TTM) data by YCharts\n\nAnd thanks to the company's earnings strength, the stock has delivered a five-year annualized return of more than 27%. Last year, Apple rose 30% as tech companies drove gains in all three major benchmarks: the Nasdaq, the S&P 500, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average.\n\nSince Apple has been around for so long, you may wonder if its biggest phases of growth are in the past. It's true that this company probably won't deliver the same growth you'll find in a younger player that's just starting to build its business or a company like Nvidia that's at the heart of the high-growth AI revolution. But the dominance Apple has built in its market over time as well as it's own expansion into AI could power a new phase of growth ahead.\n\nStory Continues\n\nA significant new opportunity\n\nApple now has an installed base of more than 2.2 billion products worldwide, and that has paved the pathway to a new, massive opportunity: services revenue. The company offers users of its products a variety of them, from digital content to cloud storage. And that has led to record services revenue quarter after quarter in recent times.\n\nOn top of that, the company has launched its AI offering, Apple Intelligence, and is integrating it into its products. That should reinforce the loyalty of fans, bringing them an even more powerful experience across devices.\n\nSo now let's get back to our question: Should you buy stock in the world's largest company? This depends on your investment strategy. If you're an aggressive investor looking for enormous growth, you may find better opportunities elsewhere. But for most other investors, Apple today still makes a compelling buy as the company has a strong moat to ensure its market leadership -- and services and AI should add to growth moving forward. All of this means the stock has room to run and could help you score an investing win over the long haul.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

The company's Hopper (H100) graphics processing units (GPUs) and successor Blackwell chips have been the preferred options for businesses wanting to run generative AI solutions and train large language models in their high-compute data centers.\n\nWith demand for GPUs overwhelming supply, Nvidia has been able to command $30,000 to $40,000 for its Hopper chip, which is up to four times as much as Advanced Micro Devices has charged customers for its Instinct MI300X GPU. Having otherworldly pricing power helped to push Nvidia's gross margin to as high as 78.4% last year.\n\nWhile the long-term outlook for AI remains encouraging and this technology has real-world applications in most industries around the globe, Nvidia's chances of becoming Wall Street's first $5 trillion company are likely going to be thwarted by history.\n\nRoughly three decades ago, the internet began going mainstream and offered businesses a new way to connect with potential customers. Though the internet did, eventually, alter the growth trajectory for corporate America is a positive way, it took years before businesses really understood how to harness these new sales and marketing channels.\n\nIncluding the internet, every game-changing technology or innovation for 30 years has navigated its way through an early stage bubble. In simpler terms, investors have consistently overestimated how quickly a new technology/innovation would be adopted or gain widespread utility. With most companies lacking clear game plans as to how they'll maximize the return on their AI investments, it sets artificial intelligence up to be the next in a long line of bubbles.\n\nStory Continues\n\nSince no company has benefited more directly from the AI revolution than Nvidia, the logical expectation is that its stock would be hit the hardest. Historic precedent makes it unlikely that Nvidia ascends to a $5 trillion valuation first.Image source: Amazon.\n\nThis dark-horse candidate has a clear path to become America's largest public company\n\nIf history were to rhyme and the AI bubble bursts, it would also be bad news for Microsoft, which has been investing heavily in an artificial intelligence-driven future. Although Microsoft's operating cash flow isn't as overwhelmingly reliant on AI as Nvidia, being the first to reach a $5 trillion valuation would be a stretch.\n\nThe same can be said for Wall Street's other $3 trillion public company, Apple. Though Apple's Services segment continues to grow by a double-digit percentage, its physical device sales, including iPhone, have stagnated for two years. Apple stock is already trading at one of its priciest valuations in a decade, which leaves little room for its valuation to rise by another $1.4 trillion.\n\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" component that appears to have the clearest path to a $5 trillion market cap is e-commerce juggernaut Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN).\n\nWhen most consumers and investors hear the Amazon name, they think of its dominant online marketplace. Last February, eMarketer estimated that Amazon would account for just over 40% of U.S. online retail sales in 2024. While this online retail platform has been the face of Amazon for nearly three decades, e-commerce plays a minimal role in terms of cash flow generation and operating income.\n\nThe lion's share of Amazon's growth potential (specifically growth in cash flow) originates from its ancillary operating segments, with Amazon Web Services (AWS) at the front of the pack.\n\nBased on data from tech-analysis firm Canalys, AWS is the world's leading cloud infrastructure service platform, with an estimated 33% share of total cloud spending during the third quarter of 2024. For context, Amazon's share of spending among cloud-service providers is more than Microsoft's Azure and Alphabet's Google Cloud, combined \u2014 and these are the No's 2 and 3 in global cloud-service spending.\n\nEven though AI has played a role in AWS's growth, enterprise spending on cloud services was growing at a steady double-digit pace long before AI became the hottest thing since sliced bread on Wall Street. With enterprise cloud-service spending still in its relatively early stages of expansion, Amazon can expect substantially higher margins from this segment to meaningfully boost its cash flow.\n\nBeyond AWS, Amazon's advertising services and subscription services (e.g., Prime) segments are also respectively growing by double digits. Amazon's push into exclusive sporting events (Thursday Night Football and NBA streaming packages) should improve demand for advertising, as well as support its subscription pricing power.\n\nThe key point is that, unlike Microsoft and Nvidia, Amazon wouldn't be dragged down by the AI bubble bursting thanks to its abundance of other catalysts.\n\nLastly, Amazon remains historically inexpensive. Throughout the 2010s, investors willingly paid 23 to 37 times year-end cash flow to own shares of the company. But as of the closing bell on Jan. 10, Amazon's shares are valued at just 13.5 times consensus cash flow for 2026. If Amazon were to reach the median year-end multiple to cash flow it traded at consistently from 2010 through 2019, it would become Wall Street's first $5 trillion company.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Lam pointed to the growing sell-through share of Pro series devices in markets like China.\n\nSamsung Electronics Co (OTC:SSNLF) led with a market share of 19% in 2024, down from 20% in 2023, backed by demand for its S24 series and A-series product lines. The S24 series gained traction as the first phone positioned as an AI device and performed exceptionally in Western Europe and the USA.\n\nXiaomi (OTC:XIACF) (OTC:XIACY) reported a 14% market share in 2024, up from 13% a year ago. Oppo and Vivo each captured an 8% market share in 2024.\n\nXiaomi grew fastest among the top five brands in 2024, backed by its premiumization and expansion activities.\n\nOppo ended the year with stronger momentum. Vivo emerged amongst the top five, led by strong performance in India and China.\n\nThe top five remained the same as in 2023 but lost some share to Huawei Technologies, Honor, and Motorola.

This is a negative signal. However, the article also mentions Apple's growth in non-core markets and a consumer shift towards premium offerings, which partially offsets the negative news. Furthermore, the overall smartphone market is growing, and analysts expect revenue growth to outpace volume growth. The current price action shows a slight decrease. Considering these factors, the negative news regarding China is likely to exert downward pressure, but the positive aspects might mitigate the fall. The China market is very important to Apple, so the loss of market share there is a significant negative. The growth in other markets is not enough to offset the loss in China. The rise of Huawei is also a significant threat to Apple. Therefore, the probability of a fall is higher than the probability of a rise."

The overall global smartphone market growth is positive, and Apple's continued dominance in revenue (projected 89-96% from iPhones in fiscal 2025) suggests resilience.  The news highlights competitive pressures from Huawei and Xiaomi, but also points to Apple's premium strategy mitigating some of the impact.  The Chinese government's potential subsidies for domestic brands present a further headwind. Considering these mixed signals, the probability of a price rise is lower than a price fall, but not drastically so, as the overall picture isn't overwhelmingly negative."

        "content": "Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) just dropped the kind of news that makes investors sit up and take notice. While U.S. export restrictions on AI chips to China might rattle others, Broadcom is shrugging it off. Citi analysts note potential risks tied to Bytedance, a key customer projected to bring in $2$3 billion in 2025 sales. But here's the kicker: AI-heavyweights like Google (GOOGL) and Meta (NASDAQ:META) are set to pump $10 billion into Broadcom's ASIC sales next year. Throw in booming demand from new powerhouses like OpenAI and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and you've got a recipe for growth that dwarfs any headwinds.\n\nHigh Yield Dividend Stocks in Gurus' Portfolio This Powerful Chart Made Peter Lynch 29% A Year For 13 Years How to calculate the intrinsic value of a stock?\n\nLet's talk numbers, because Broadcom's fiscal 2024 results are jaw-dropping. Revenue soared 44% to a record $51.6 billion, with AI leading the chargea staggering 220% jump in AI revenue to $12.2 billion. Its semiconductor and infrastructure software segments smashed expectations, delivering $30.1 billion and $21.5 billion, respectively. The cherry on top? An 11% quarterly dividend hike to $0.59 per share, marking the 14th consecutive annual increase. Oh, and the company's free cash flow? A whopping $19.4 billion, positioning Broadcom to keep rewarding investors while powering ahead.\n\nLooking forward, Broadcom is brimming with confidence, forecasting a 22% revenue jump in Q1 FY25 to $14.6 billion. Citi remains bullish, slapping a Buy rating and a $220 price target on the stock. Broadcom isn't just riding the AI waveit's building the surfboard, the wave, and the entire beach. If you're looking for a leader in tech that knows how to navigate challenges and crush expectations, Broadcom's got your attention.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

While the article primarily discusses Broadcom, it mentions Apple (AAPL) as a source of growing demand for Broadcom's ASICs. This implies a positive, albeit indirect, impact on Apple. Apple's reliance on Broadcom as a supplier suggests that Broadcom's success in AI could benefit Apple's own AI-related initiatives and product development. However, the impact is less direct than if the news were about Apple's own earnings or product launches. Therefore, the probability of a significant rise in Apple's stock price is moderate. The probability of a fall is low, as the news doesn't present any negative information about Apple. The overall sentiment is positive for the tech sector, which could provide a slight boost to Apple's stock."

This positive association with a key supplier experiencing explosive growth in the AI sector could indirectly benefit Apple. However, the impact is likely to be indirect and relatively small. The news is not directly about Apple's performance or any specific Apple product or initiative. Therefore, the probability of a significant price movement in Apple's stock due to this news is low.

Furthermore, Apple's growth in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, coupled with strong demand for Pro and Pro Max models in China (potentially reaching 50% of Q4 sales), suggests continued strength in key markets.  The discounts in China are a concern, indicating competitive pressure, but this is a strategic move to maintain market share in a crucial region. The overall improvement in global consumer sentiment is a positive macroeconomic factor.  The delays in Apple Intelligence features are a negative, but their impact on overall sales is unclear from the provided information. Considering the mixed nature of the news, a slight negative impact on the stock price is more likely than a significant positive or negative one.

However, the overall market sentiment, influenced by the broader economic outlook and other tech company earnings, will also play a significant role.  Given the uncertainty, assigning precise probabilities is difficult, but a slightly higher probability is assigned to a price rise based on the general expectation that strong corporate earnings can support the market, even with higher interest rates.  This is not a guarantee, and external factors could easily outweigh the impact of Apple's earnings."

If Apple's earnings growth is strong, it could potentially revive the stock rally. However, if the earnings growth is weak, it could further dampen the market sentiment. Given the general nature of the news, it does not specifically highlight Apple's strengths or weaknesses, so the impact is somewhat neutral but leaning towards caution.

Many millions of us have the company's devices in our pockets, handbags, or desktops, and many millions send Apple lots of money every year. Indeed, in Apple's last fiscal year, it raked in $391 billion in revenue. Better still, it kept fully 24% of that, more than $90 billion, as net income.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSo it won't surprise you that Apple is among the largest companies in the world. It's actually the biggest company in the world, with a recent market value of $3.68 trillion, ahead of Nvidia ($3.54 trillion), Microsoft ($3.15 trillion), Alphabet ($2.36 trillion), and Amazon ($2.36 trillion).\n\nDespite all that, investing in Apple is not a no-brainer move. It does require a little brain work, because there are both reasons to invest in it and reasons you might not want to.\n\nWhy you might invest in Apple\n\nHere are some solid reasons to consider investing in Apple stock:\n\nIt has been investing heavily in artificial intelligence (AI), which may pay off handsomely. Some expect that \"Apple Intelligence,\" which is already incorporated in many products, may drive a lot of upgrades. Some expect that, with more than 2 billion Apple devices in existence, Apple may become the biggest provider of AI to consumers. Apple is a dividend-paying stock. Its dividend yield was recently only 0.41%, but that payout has been growing -- by an average annual rate of about 6%. It's currently paying about $0.99 per share per year, up from $0.76 in 2019 and $0.51 in 2015. Apple has done a lot of repurchasing of its own shares, so that its total yield to shareholders, including both dividends and buybacks, per Morningstar, was recently 3%. Apple is financially healthy, and its lucrative business results in its having the means to invest heavily in its future growth, whether via research and development or acquisitions.\n\nWhy you might not want to invest in Apple\n\nDespite all that, there's a good reason to think twice before investing in Apple: its valuation. Consider these recent metrics:\n\nMetric Recent Five-Year Average Price-to-sales ratio (PSR) 9.5 6.9 Price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio 39.8 28.4 Forward-looking P/E ratio 32.4 26.8 Price-to-cash flow ratio 32.6 23.3\n\nData source: Morningstar as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nIf you buy into Apple now and hold for many years or decades, you'll likely make money -- and potentially a lot of it. Nevertheless, it is not unlikely for an overvalued stock to fall back to a more reasonable level. And if you were to buy at a lower level, all your gains would be greater. Much depends on your risk tolerance.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeanwhile, those rich valuation numbers are a result of some terrific performances in recent years:\n\nYear Apple Gain (or Loss) 2024 30.1% 2023 48.2% 2022 (26.8%) 2021 33.8% 2020 80.8% 2019 86.2% 2018 (6.8%) 2017 46.1% 2016 10.0%\n\nData source: 1stock1.com as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nAnother reason to think twice about investing in Apple is that it hasn't introduced a revolutionary new product in a long time. Granted, few companies ever do, but Apple has done so multiple times, with offerings such as the iPod, iPad, iPhone, Apple Watch, and more.\n\nWhat should you do?\n\nWhether you should buy, sell, or hold Apple depends a lot on you. Do you see the company continuing to introduce great new products in the years to come and having its value grow accordingly? Do you think its current price is reasonable, a bargain, or very overvalued?\n\nI think it's reasonable to expect Apple to not deliver 80% gains in any future years, though it could, of course, happen. Once a company is worth several trillion dollars, it can be harder to grow quickly, though it's still possible.\n\nIf you're tempted but unsure, you might buy a small position in Apple, or establish a bigger position over time, buying shares incrementally. Or just add the stock to your watch list and wait and hope for a more attractive entry point.\n\nI am an Apple shareholder personally, and I'm planning to remain one for a long time. I have, however, shed some shares over the past year or two -- in part so that I don't have too many eggs in that one Apple basket, and in part because I see various other stocks as also promising and more undervalued.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

The lack of recent revolutionary products is also mentioned as a potential concern. While past performance is impressive, sustaining such high growth rates is unlikely given Apple's current size. The overall tone leans slightly cautious, suggesting a higher probability of a price correction than significant further gains in the short to medium term.

        "headline": "Here Are the Top 5 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks to Buy in 2025, According to 1 Wall Street Analyst",
        "content": "Dan Ives is the managing director and global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities. He is a frequent contributor on financial news programming and actively posts his latest stock predictions on social media.\n\nRecently, Ives published his top picks among megacap technology stocks for 2025. Unsurprisingly, many of his choices are among the \"Magnificent Seven.\"\n\nBelow, I'll explore individual catalysts that each of these companies contains and make the case for why 2025 could be a great opportunity to buy these stocks hand over fist.\n\n1. Tesla\n\nTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) is probably the most interesting name on Ives' list. For much of 2024, shares of Tesla underperformed the broader market. But beginning in early November, shares started going parabolic. All told, Tesla stock gained 62% in 2024 -- nearly triple that of the S&P 500 and more than double the gains seen in the Nasdaq Composite.\n\nThe catalyst that fueled Tesla's rebound? The outcome of the U.S. presidential election.\n\nDuring the final months of Donald Trump's campaign, Tesla CEO Elon Musk emerged as a steadfast surrogate for the Republican candidate. Following Trump's victory in early November, Ives made it clear that he sees Musk's relationship with the president-elect as a major tailwind for the future of Tesla.\n\nSpecifically, Ives thinks that the incoming Trump administration could fast-track Tesla's autonomous driving and robotaxi plans. While I think Ives' outlook makes sense, it's important to note that a lot of upside has already been factored into Tesla's share price following the election results.\n\n2. Nvidia\n\nIs it really surprising to see Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) listed as a top idea for 2025?\n\nLast year, Nvidia was the top-performing Magnificent Seven stock -- with shares climbing 171% and the company's valuation gaining more than $2 trillion!NVDA data by YCharts\n\nDespite this unprecedented move, Ives is calling for significantly more upside in the chip darling.\n\nThis year, Nvidia's biggest tailwind stems from its newest GPU lineup, known as Blackwell. With industry analysts calling for surging demand for Nvidia's new architecture, 2025 is already looking like another milestone year for the semiconductor leader.\n\nWith a $4 trillion valuation within reach, investors may want to consider scooping up shares of Nvidia now -- before the company begins reporting official stats on Blackwell and its impact on the business.\n\n3. Microsoft\n\nI see Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) as one of the safest AI opportunities in big tech. Over the last two years, the company has invested billions into AI infrastructure -- namely through a critically important partnership with OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMicrosoft has benefited greatly from ChatGPT, primarily by integrating the service into its Azure cloud computing ecosystem. Despite intense competition from the likes of Amazon, Alphabet, and Oracle, Microsoft has been able to command respectable growth tied directly to its AI initiatives -- a trend that I think is only just beginning to bear fruit.\n\nIn addition, Microsoft also has an early lead in one of AI's next big megatrends, agentic AI. The company's agentic AI virtual assistant, called CoPilot, is used by almost 70% of the Fortune 500.\n\nTo me, Microsoft has demonstrated an ability to maneuver around the competitive landscape and deserves to be a top choice for AI investors.Image source: Getty Images.\n\n4. Apple\n\nWhile Ives has remained bullish on Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) for some time, I have my concerns. According to Ives, Apple's new iPhone 16 equipped with Apple Intelligence should inspire customers to upgrade their devices en masse. Although the idea of an iPhone supercycle makes sense, I question how it will play out in reality.\n\nApple was late to the AI game, and I'm not sure if Apple Intelligence provides enough value add to cause users to upgrade their phones. Remember, Apple's consumer hardware devices are a bit of a luxury. If your old iPhone is still manageable, Apple's AI features might not be enough of a selling point to assume a higher-cost device.\n\nWhile I'd love to be proven wrong on this one, Apple is the one stock on this list that I'm hesitant about right now.\n\n5. Alphabet\n\nTo me, Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) is the biggest bargain among the five AI stocks I've explored. Similar to Microsoft, Alphabet has a deep ecosystem in which it can integrate all sorts of AI-powered services -- from cloud computing to workplace productivity tools, advertising, streaming, consumer hardware, and more.\n\nAlphabet is an extremely diversified business, and the company's revenue and profit growth are both headed in the right direction.GOOGL Revenue (Quarterly) data by YCharts\n\nYet, despite the company's impressive growth and lucrative AI opportunities, Alphabet only trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 21.9 -- that's lower than the average forward P/E of the S&P 500.\n\nI think investors are remaining overly cautious when it comes to Alphabet, given the intense competition in the cloud space from Microsoft and Amazon, as well as rising competitive forces in advertising from social media platforms offered by Meta Platforms and TikTok.\n\nWhile I understand these concerns in theory, I think Alphabet's financial results depicted above speak for themselves. To me, an investment in Alphabet will continue to outperform that of the broader market for years to come. I think Alphabet stock is an outright bargain right now and see an opportunity for long-term investors to buy the stock hand over fist.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

The article's focus is on the analyst's overall picks, not a deep dive into Apple's specific financial situation or future prospects. Therefore, the probability of a price rise is considered moderate, while the probability of a fall or stagnation is higher."

Dan Ives is a well-known and respected analyst in the tech sector, so his opinion carries weight. However, the headline only mentions being *among* the top 5, not definitively *the* top pick. Also, the news is forward-looking (2025), so the immediate impact might be limited. The impact is further diluted by the fact that it's one analyst's opinion, and the 'Magnificent Seven' are already heavily followed and priced based on future expectations. Therefore, while the news is generally positive, the impact is likely to be moderate. I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a rise than a fall, but not overwhelmingly so."

Second, it's the opinion of a single analyst, not a consensus view.  Third, the news itself doesn't provide any specific reasons for the analyst's prediction, making it difficult to assess the strength of the bullish case.  Therefore, while the news is mildly positive, it's unlikely to significantly impact the stock price in the short term.

Apple's business is significantly diversified, and the loss of TikTok's revenue is unlikely to be a major factor affecting its overall financial performance. Therefore, the news is expected to have a negligible effect on Apple's stock price.  Any price movement would likely be due to other market factors rather than this specific news."

However, the impact on Apple's overall revenue is likely to be minimal given the diversity of its revenue streams (iPhone sales, services, wearables, etc.).

Additionally, the fact that Apple is one of nine stocks in Buffett's portfolio may dilute the positive effect.

Furthermore, a projected recovery in the PC market by at least 5% is expected to push Dell\u2019s free cash flow up 15% for the year and into low double digits in 2026.\n\nWith the company\u2019s shares trading at 12% of estimated 2026 free cash flow (FCF), \u201cthe risk-reward is highly favorable given the synchronous recovery in end-markets next year,\u201d UBS analysts led by David Vogt said in a note.\n\nMeanwhile, TD SYNNEX stands out as the firm\u2019s preferred mid-cap stock. UBS forecasts 5% growth in billings, driven by recovering end markets in PCs, networking, servers, and storage.\n\nThe company is also expected to return 50% of its FCF to shareholders through dividends and buybacks, shrinking its share count by approximately 5% and driving 10% earnings per share (EPS) growth.\n\nAnalysts also highlight the strength of TD SYNNEX\u2019s AI infrastructure business, Hyve, which is projected to reach several billion dollars in revenue with operating margins exceeding corporate averages.\n\n\u201cAs the market properly values this unit, we expect TD SYNNEX\u2019s price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple to expand from 9x to more in-line with legacy tech peers around 10-12x,\u201d analysts said.\n\nOn the other hand, analysts advise against IBM and Pure Storage stocks in 2025, citing limited upside.\n\nThe note highlights that while AI-driven growth is selective, IBM and Pure Storage have minimal exposure to AI revenue for the year.\n\n\u201cWhile heavily exposed AI names should see upward revisions in CY25, we expect limited upside revisions (absent acquisitions) at IBM, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Pure Storage given de minimis AI related revenue/exposure in 2025,\u201d analysts highlighted.\n\nUBS also highlights IBM\u2019s second-half-weighted 2025 earnings profile and the risk of a Q1 EPS miss, calling it \u201can unfavorable risk/reward in our view\u201d with the stock trading at 21x next twelve months (NTM) consensus EPS.\n\nMeanwhile, Pure Storage\u2019s share loss in all-flash and soft demand for Everrgreen//One subscriptions represent growth headwinds for 2025, analysts said.\n\nStory Continues\n\nRelated Articles\n\nBuy Dell and TD SYNNEX shares in 2025, avoid IBM, Pure Storage: UBS\n\nBlinken visits Japan as Nippon Steel decision weighs on relations\n\nUS adds Tencent, CATL to list of Chinese firms allegedly aiding Beijing's military\n\nView Comments",

This suggests a slightly negative outlook for Apple, as the market is currently very focused on AI-related growth. However, the article doesn't provide specific negative information about Apple's core business or future prospects beyond AI. Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be mild.

Based on this, it is reasonable to assume that the stock price may be negatively affected."

Although the news content is not provided, the headline alone suggests a potential decline in investor sentiment. Based on this, it is likely that the stock price may fall. However, without knowing the specific details of the news, the probability of the stock price rising is not zero, as there could be other factors influencing the stock price. Therefore, a probability of 0.2 is assigned to the stock price rising, and a probability of 0.8 is assigned to the stock price falling, reflecting the negative tone of the headline."

The market's reaction will depend on various factors, including overall market sentiment, Apple's upcoming earnings reports, and competitor performance.

Stock prices are influenced by numerous factors beyond individual analyst predictions, including overall market conditions, economic indicators, competitor actions, and Apple's own financial performance.  Therefore, while the prediction suggests potential for a price rise, assigning a high probability based solely on this limited information would be imprudent. A more balanced approach acknowledges the possibility of both price increases and decreases, with the probability of a rise being moderately higher due to the bullish prediction, but still significantly less than certainty."

However, the news is backward-looking, reporting on holdings 'as 2025 begins'. The market may have already priced this information in. Therefore, while positive, the impact might be muted.

His continued significant holding in Apple suggests confidence in the company's future prospects. However, the news itself is not specific to Apple and doesn't provide any new information about Apple's performance or outlook. Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal.

On the other hand, if Apple is not among the five stocks, the news might not have a significant direct impact on Apple's stock price.

However, this type of historical success does not directly influence immediate stock price movements.
