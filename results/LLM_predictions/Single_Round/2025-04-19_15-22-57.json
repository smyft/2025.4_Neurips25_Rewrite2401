        "headline": "Mag 7 Earnings &amp; DeepSeek: What Should Investors Know?",
        "content": "DeekSeek appears to have put a big dent in what everyone believed was a source of competitive advantage in the AI race for Tech leaders like Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL, Amazon AMZN, and others. And if we go by how Microsoft and Meta described the evolving AI competitive landscape on their respective Q4 earnings calls last week, we will most likely hear comparable commentary from Amazon and Alphabet as they come out with their December-quarter results this week.\n\nMarket participants have all along been skeptical of the investment case for the extraordinarily heavy spending by Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and others on AI-centric data centers and related infrastructure. The issue all along has been these companies\u2019 inability to articulate a clear case for how these investments will get monetized.\n\nWhile a lot about DeepSeek\u2019s actual cost in building and training its model is unknown, notwithstanding the announced figure of a few million dollars, the hundreds of billions of dollars that these companies are collectively pouring into the project appears to be overkill. Microsoft and Meta reiterated their spending plans and see the resulting data center capacity as giving them a strategic advantage in the long run. We can safely assume that Amazon and Alphabet will follow Microsoft and Meta on this crucial question.\n\nWhile the market\u2019s collective focus was mainly on the AI question for Microsoft and Meta, the former disappointed in its core results, with cloud guidance coming up short, while the latter showed plenty of operating momentum in operating results. Microsoft\u2019s December-quarter earnings were up +10.2% from the same period last year on +12.3% higher revenues, while Meta\u2019s earnings and revenues increased +48.7% and +20.6% from the year-earlier levels, respectively.\n\nApple and Tesla, the other Mag 7 players that also reported results last week, received favorable market reception. However, the positive market follow-through was likely less of a response to the core results and more of a sigh of relief at better-than-feared numbers.\n\nChina has emerged as a major risk in the Apple story, with tepid iPhone demand in that key market and the company\u2019s continuing AI struggles taking center stage. Some anecdotal evidence suggests that some of Apple\u2019s local Chinese competitors are giving it a lot tougher competition than in years past. On top of that is the prospect of tariffs, a far bigger issue for Apple than the rest of its Mag 7 peers.\n\nApple\u2019s December-quarter earnings were up +7.1% on +4% higher revenues, while Tesla\u2019s earnings and revenues for the period were up +15.7% and +2.1% from the year-earlier level, respectively. Net margins were up at Apple and Tesla, with Apple\u2019s margins up 86 basis points from the same period last year while Tesla\u2019s expanded 105 bps.\n\n\u7e7c\u7e8c\u95b1\u8b80\n\nTake a look at the chart below that shows current consensus expectations for the \u2018Mag 7\u2019 stocks as a whole for the current and coming periods in the context of what they were able to achieve in the preceding period. The +25.6% earnings growth comprises actual results from the four group members that have reported and estimates for Alphabet, Amazon, and Nvidia (that haven\u2019t reported yet).Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe chart below that shows the group\u2019s earnings and revenue growth on an annual basis.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBeyond these Mag 7 players, total Q4 earnings for the Technology sector as a whole are expected to be up +19.2% from the same period last year on +10.8% higher revenues.\n\nThe chart below shows the sector\u2019s Q4 earnings and revenue growth expectations in the context of where growth has been in recent quarters and what is expected in the coming three periods.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe chart below shows the sector\u2019s growth picture on an annual basis.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe Tech sector has enjoyed a favorable revisions trend for the last few quarters, with the Mag 7 stocks in the fore front of the rising estimates trend. The +16.9% earnings growth expected for the sector for 2025 at present is up from the +15.8% growth expected three months back.\n\nQ4 Earnings Season Scorecard\n\nThrough Friday, January 31st, we have seen Q4 results from 179 S&P 500 members, or 35.8% of the index\u2019s total membership. Total earnings for these companies are up +7.4% from the same period last year on +5.1% higher revenues, with 80.4% beating EPS estimates and 67% beating revenue estimates.\n\nThe comparison charts below put the Q4 earnings and revenue growth rates relative to other recent periods for the same group of index members.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe comparison charts below put the Q4 EPS and revenue beats percentages relative to other recent periods for the same group of companies.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nKey Earnings Reports This Week\n\nThe 132 S&P 500 members on deck to report results this week include several blue-chip operators like Pfizer, Pepsi, Ford, and others, in addition to the aforementioned Mag 7 players (Amazon and Alphabet).\n\nBy the end of this week, we will have seen Q4 results from more than 63% of the index\u2019s total membership.\n\nThe Earnings Big Picture\n\nThe chart below shows the Q4 earnings and revenue growth expectations in the context of where growth has been in the preceding four quarters and what is expected in the coming four quarters.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nExcluding the contribution from the Mag 7 companies, S&P 500 earnings would have been up +5.6% on +4.1% higher revenues.\n\nThe chart below shows the overall earnings picture on a calendar-year basis, with double-digit earnings growth expected in 2025 and 2026.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nPlease note that the very strong growth expected in 2025 is not driven by one or two sectors but is rather broad-based. All 16 Zacks sectors are expected to enjoy positive earnings growth in 2025, with 8 of the 16 Zacks sectors expected to achieve double-digit earnings growth.\n\nFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>> Broad Based Sector Growth Expected for 2025\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "headline": "Apple Scraps Work on Mac-Connected Augmented Reality Glasses",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. has canceled a project to build advanced augmented reality glasses that would pair with its devices, marking the latest setback in its effort to create a headset that appeals to typical consumers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHow the 2025 Catholic Jubilee Is Reshaping Rome Trump Paves the Way to Deputize Local Police on Immigration Manhattan\u2019s Morning Commute Time Drops With New Congestion Toll Historic London Elevator Faces Last Stop in Labour\u2019s Housing Push Housing Aid Uncertain After Trump\u2019s Spending Freeze Memo\n\nThe company shuttered the program this week, according to people with knowledge of the move. The now-canceled product would have looked like normal glasses but include built-in displays and require a connection to a Mac, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the work wasn\u2019t public. An Apple representative declined to comment.\n\nThe project had been seen as a potential way forward after the weak introduction of the Apple Vision Pro, a $3,499 model that was too cumbersome and pricey to catch on with consumers. The hope was to produce something that everyday users could embrace, but finding the right technology \u2014 at the right cost \u2014 has proven to be a challenge.\n\nApple risks losing ground to Meta Platforms Inc., which already sells a popular set of Ray-Ban smart glasses. Meta is working to create a version that adds augmented reality \u2014 the superimposing of images and data on real-world views \u2014 and expects to have a product ready by 2027. That\u2019s when Apple had previously intended to sell its device-connected glasses, which were code-named N107.\n\nThe decision to wind down work on the N107 product followed an attempt to revamp the design, according to the people. The company had initially wanted the glasses to pair with an iPhone, but it ran into problems over how much processing power the handset could provide. It also affected the iPhone\u2019s battery life. So the company shifted to an approach that required linking up with a Mac computer, which has faster processors and bigger batteries.\n\nBut the Mac-connected product performed poorly during reviews with executives, and the desired features continued to change. Members of Apple\u2019s Vision Products Group, which worked on the device, grew increasingly concerned that the project was on the rocks. Sure enough, the final word came this week that the effort was over.\n\nThe glasses are the latest example of Apple giving up on a once-promising technology. Last year, the company axed its decadelong effort to build a self-driving car. It also canceled work on custom Apple Watch screens in 2024.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe Vision Pro remains a technical marvel, even with its slow start. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook touted the product during an earnings conference call Thursday, saying that more corporate customers are embracing it.\n\nBut employees in Apple\u2019s Vision Products Group, or VPG, believe there\u2019s a lack of focus and clear direction within the team, which is overseen by executive Mike Rockwell and company hardware chief John Ternus. The N107 retreat is just the latest failed attempt to make Apple\u2019s headset technology successful, they say, and that\u2019s hurting morale.\n\nThe company is still working on successors to the Vision Pro, including updated versions of the original model. It also has other concepts in the works, such as AirPods with cameras, and executives still hope to eventually create a set of standalone AR glasses someday.\n\nApple has made other recent changes. Last week, one of the Vision Pro team\u2019s top executives moved to the AI division.\n\nThe N107 device had advanced projectors that could display information, images and video in the field of view for each eye, similar to augmented reality glasses being developed by Meta and others. Despite the project being shuttered, Apple is still working on underlying technologies that could be used in AR glasses down the road, including custom microLED-type screens, Bloomberg News reported this week.\n\nThe holy grail for the industry is creating fully standalone glasses \u2014 with their own screens, processor and operating system \u2014 that wouldn\u2019t require a smartphone or computer. Last year, Meta previewed prototype glasses called Orion that come close to this design, though they do connect to a wireless puck that handles the computing. Meta expects developers to start buying test units in 2026, helping them create software for the device. The launch of a consumer version \u2014 code-named Artemis \u2014 is planned for 2027.\n\nThe canceled Apple device also would have been similar to devices such as Xreal Inc.\u2019s One spectacles and Lenovo Group Ltd.\u2019s ThinkReality. The Vision Pro, in contrast, is a mixed-reality headset. It melds virtual reality with a version of AR that relies on cameras to show the outside world \u2014 rather than just letting users peer through glass at the real thing.\n\nWith its AR glasses project, Apple had hoped to capitalize on one of the more compelling features of visionOS, the operating system that runs on the Vision Pro. It can link up with a Mac and let people handle computing tasks in mixed reality. That means the Vision Pro can serve as a giant, virtual monitor that feels like it curves around a user.\n\nPrototypes of the device were light enough to not require a strap to wrap around a wearer\u2019s head \u2014 a requirement of the heavier Vision Pro. Apple also removed the front-facing screen on today\u2019s Vision Pro that shows a wearer\u2019s eyes. Though that technology is one of the more memorable aspects of the current headset, the feature adds cost and weight.\n\nBut the device did still have some bells and whistles: The company worked on including lenses that could change their tint depending on what a user is doing. The idea was to tell an onlooker if the person is present and approachable \u2014 or busy working on computing tasks.\n\nThe N107 decision marks at least the second time Apple has walked away from an AR project. Around two years ago, it shelved its first effort, a project code-named N421. Apple had originally aimed to bring those glasses to market around a year after the initial Vision Pro. Apple canceled N421, in part, to focus on a new mixed-reality headset code-named N109, which has been discussed as a cheaper variant of the Vision Pro\u2019s VR-based design.\n\nCompany executives were originally compelled by the N107 idea because of past success with devices like the Apple Watch and AirPods, which serve as accessories to its main products. In recent years, Apple\u2019s Wearables, Home and Accessories segment has eclipsed its Mac and iPad divisions in revenue.\n\nThe failure of the N107 glasses leaves Apple with one fewer avenue for finding a new hit product. So far, the Vision Pro doesn\u2019t have mass consumer appeal.\n\nWithin Apple, the Vision Pro\u2019s slow sales were initially blamed on its hefty price tag \u2014 roughly seven times the level of Meta\u2019s Quest 3 headset. But there\u2019s been another, more troubling development: People who already own the device aren\u2019t using it as much as the company had anticipated.\n\nThat puts Apple in a quandary. Even if it can make a headset cheaper and lighter, it still has to figure out how to make the product resonate with consumers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIndy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans The Internet Almost Killed Barnes & Noble, Then Saved It What America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments",

        "content": "The DeepSeek app is displayed on an iPhone screen. - Illustration: Justin Sullivan (Getty Images)\n\nEarlier this week, Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek sparked a sell-off of global tech stocks that lost the AI-driven stock rally $1 trillion in value.\n\nThe Hangzhou-based company launched its open-source DeepSeek-R1 AI reasoning models the previous week, declaring them on par with those from OpenAI and Anthropic. In December, the startup released DeepSeek-V3, an AI model it said cost just $5.6 million to train and develop on just under 2,050 of Nvidia\u2019s (NVDA) reduced-capability H800 chips. V3, according to the startup\u2019s technical paper, performed comparably to OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o and Meta\u2019s (META) Llama 3.1 models, which use a much larger quantity of Nvidia\u2019s more powerful chips.\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s cheaper-yet-competitive models have raised questions over Big Tech\u2019s big spending on AI infrastructure. Unsurprisingly, the Chinese startup made its way into Big Tech earnings calls this week, and the chief executives of Microsoft, Meta, and Apple took an optimistic tone while discussing what DeepSeek\u2019s models could mean for the industry.\n\nHere\u2019s what Big Tech is saying about DeepSeek.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nDespite launching an investigation this week over whether a group associated with DeepSeek obtained data output from OpenAI\u2019s AI models in violation of the startup\u2019s terms of service, Microsoft launched DeepSeek-R1 on its Azure AI Foundry (MSFT) and GitHub.\n\nMicrosoft chief executive Satya Nadella said during the company\u2019s earnings call on Wednesday that developers will also be able to run the startup\u2019s distilled reasoning models on Copilot+ PCs soon.\n\nIn response to an analyst\u2019s question about DeepSeek, Nadella said he thinks it \u201chas had some real innovations.\u201d As AI reasoning models such as those from DeepSeek and OpenAI get \u201ccommoditized\u201d and \u201cbroadly used,\u201d Nadella said customers will be \u201cthe big beneficiaries\u201d of that software cycle.\n\n\u201cWhen token prices fall, inference computing prices fall, that means people can consume more, and there will be more apps written,\u201d Nadella said.\n\nMeta\n\nMeta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg, who touts open-source AI models as \u201cgood for the world,\u201d said during the company\u2019s earnings call on Wednesday that DeepSeek did \u201ca number of novel things\u201d with its open-source models that the industry is \u201cstill digesting,\u201d and that the startup has made \u201cadvances that we will hope to implement in our systems.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s part of the nature of how this works,\u201d he said, \u201cwhether it\u2019s a Chinese competitor or not.\u201d\n\nHowever, Zuckerberg said it\u2019s too early to have a strong opinion on what DeepSeek means for the trajectory of Meta\u2019s plans for AI infrastructure and capital expenditures.\n\nLa historia contin\u00faa\n\nEarlier this month, Zuckerberg said Meta is planning to invest between $60 billion and $65 billion in capex on AI this year. The company is also building a data center with a capacity of more than two gigawatts, he said \u2014 a site that could cover a large part of Manhattan. Meta plans to bring about one gigawatt of compute online this year, Zuckerberg said, and will end the year with more than 1.3 million graphics processing units, or GPUs.\n\nApple\n\nWhile Apple (AAPL) stock avoided the DeepSeek sell-off, Apple chief executive Tim Cook was asked by an analyst for his \u201cworldly perspective\u201d on the AI startup and its implications for the iPhone maker\u2019s business.\n\n\u201cIn general, I think innovation that drives efficiency is a good thing,\u201d Cook said. \u201cYou know, that\u2019s what you see in that model.\u201d\n\nHowever, Apple is facing another problem in China, with its revenue being down 11% year over year for the quarter ended in December.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nVer comentarios",

        "headline": "Apple Inc. (AAPL): Integrating AI in Devices for Personal Privacy",
        "content": "We recently published a list of Coatue\u2019s 35 Most Important AI Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against Coatue\u2019s other most important AI stocks.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has fueled a major rally in the technology sector, driving up key market indices. Over the past year, the S&P 500, heavily influenced by tech giants, has risen by nearly 22%, while the tech-heavy NASDAQ Composite has surged over 26%. Initially, market analysts had predicted an increase in interest around growth options for 2024 due to easing inflation and potential rate cuts. However, AI has taken this expected interest and amplified it into an economy-wide wave of optimism. While tech stocks have been the primary beneficiaries, AI\u2019s influence is expanding across industries such as manufacturing, supply chain, transportation, entertainment, and retail.\n\nInvestment in AI is growing rapidly across various sectors. A recent Goldman Sachs report estimates that global businesses will invest nearly $1 trillion in AI infrastructure over the next few years. Venture capital (VC) investments in AI startups are also on the rise. In the first half of 2024 alone, VC firms made approximately 200 AI-related deals, injecting nearly $22 billion into the sector. The average AI startup funding round now exceeds $100 million, with company valuations averaging over $1 billion. In contrast, non-AI startups typically receive around $20 million in funding and have valuations near $200 million, indicating AI\u2019s outsized appeal to investors.\n\nCompanies that were early adopters of AI have experienced significant gains, particularly those specializing in graphics processing units (GPUs), AI chips, and generative AI technologies. The median returns of AI-linked firms in the S&P 500 stand at 20%, compared to just 2% for non-AI stocks. AI companies are also responsible for 90% of the total returns on the NASDAQ Composite Index. These gains are expected to drive earnings growth and contribute to broader economic expansion. According to Joseph Briggs, a senior global economist at Goldman Sachs, AI is projected to automate 25% of all work tasks in the next decade, increasing US productivity by 9% and boosting GDP growth by more than 6%.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nPhilippe Laffont of Coatue Management argues that AI could be the start of a new \u201csuper cycle\u201d in the tech industry. Previous cycles included the rise of personal computers in the 1980s, networking in the 1990s, wired internet in the 2000s, and mobile internet in the 2010s, leading to the cloud era. However, software and internet experts Kash Rangan and Eric Sheridan highlight a key difference: this time, companies are linking AI investments directly to revenue generation, providing a financial safety net that was absent in past cycles.\n\nStory Continues\n\nSince the launch of ChatGPT by OpenAI in early 2023, the industry\u2019s focus has shifted from software to AI hardware and infrastructure. AI infrastructure companies have collectively added nearly $6 trillion to their market capitalization since Q1 2023. Before large-scale AI automation becomes commonplace\u2014MIT economist Daron Acemoglu estimates this will take more than a decade\u2014AI infrastructure is expanding into areas such as utilities, energy, internet, and industrials. Interestingly, companies in these sectors that support AI development have posted returns rivaling those of traditional AI firms.\n\nThe growing demand for AI-driven data centers is also driving investments in the energy and utilities sectors. Goldman Sachs analysts Carly Davenport and Alberto Gandolf expect AI adoption to drive a surge in electricity demand not seen in decades. However, whether AI\u2019s growth will align with energy infrastructure investments remains uncertain due to regulatory constraints and supply chain limitations in the utilities sector. Even if necessary investments materialize, their full benefits may take years to reach AI companies.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nSome investors remain cautious, fearing an AI bubble similar to the dot-com crash of the early 2000s. However, current data suggests that AI valuations are far more grounded than those of the dot-com era. At the height of the dot-com bubble, software firms traded at price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios of 132x, compared to a five-year average of 37x in 1999. In contrast, in 2023, even the biggest AI stocks had P/E ratios around 39x, with a five-year average of 40x. These figures suggest that AI valuations are not overinflated, reinforcing investor confidence in AI\u2019s long-term potential.\n\nAI companies are increasingly targeting multi-trillion-dollar valuations, comparable to today\u2019s largest software and internet firms. Over the past decade, tech giants have scaled their businesses to unprecedented levels, combining billions of users, hundreds of billions in revenue, and tens of billions in net income. Today, a handful of firms account for 80% of the valuation of the Fortune 500. These companies dominate industries such as smartphones, e-commerce, cloud computing, and software-as-a-service (SaaS), all of which AI is poised to disrupt. As a result, these firms are aggressively incorporating AI into their business strategies to maintain market leadership.\n\nSome investors worry that AI firms could overshadow software companies, impacting long-term valuations. The price-to-sales (P/S) ratio for software stocks, which peaked in 2021, is now at an all-time low. Slower earnings growth has also contributed to negative sentiment in the sector. Coatue\u2019s research shows that over the next twelve months, only 1% of SaaS companies expect 30% earnings growth, down from 30% during the SaaS boom. However, as human-machine interaction shifts towards natural language processing and generative AI, software companies that successfully integrate AI into their platforms are likely to thrive.\n\nAs inflation cools, rate hikes ease, and prospects for a soft economic landing improve, AI\u2019s macroeconomic outlook remains strong. AI is now the primary driver of future earnings growth in the S&P 500. According to Coatue\u2019s projections, AI-linked stocks are expected to grow at a compound annual rate of nearly 20% over the next three years, outperforming non-AI stocks by approximately 14%. Additionally, 40% of future tech sector earnings are expected to be fueled by AI advancements. All available data points to a bright future for AI investments, with its influence extending far beyond traditional tech firms. As companies continue integrating AI into their operations, productivity and economic growth are set to accelerate, making AI one of the most transformative forces in modern history.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through a note on the AI industry by Coatue Management. These stocks are also popular among other hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(AAPL): Integrating AI in Devices for Personal Privacy\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. In October 2024, the company launched Apple Intelligence, a personal AI system for iPhone, iPad, and Mac, designed to assist users in writing, expressing themselves, and completing tasks efficiently. This system emphasizes user privacy by processing data on-device, ensuring personal information remains secure. Financially, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported a record revenue of $94.9 billion in the September 2024 quarter, marking a 6% increase from the previous year. CEO Tim Cook attributed this growth to the introduction of new products, including the iPhone 16 lineup, Apple Watch Series 10, and AirPods 4. Despite the introduction of AI features, the iPhone 16 series did not experience a significant sales boost, leading to concerns about the immediate financial benefits of AI.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 6th on our list of Coatue\u2019s most important AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for a stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

Meanwhile services revenue was up 14%, with revenue from China down 11%.\n\n\"Overall another very strong quarter,\" said Neil Wilson, analyst at Tipranks. \"It was the first quarterly numbers since the rollout of Apple Intelligence, the company\u2019s suite of AI features. Apple (AAPL) expects growth in the March quarter of \u201clow to mid-single digits\u201d and \u201clow double digits\u201d growth for its Services division\".\n\nFor the year-to-date Apple (AAPL) stock is 2.6% lower, knocked amid a wider tech rout related to worries around Chinese AI challenger DeepSeek.\n\n\u201cThe roll-out of AI services on iPhone 16 hasn\u2019t exactly gone smoothly. Having been late to the AI party in the first place, Apple (AAPL) still hasn\u2019t rolled out AI services in any non-English language,\" said Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell.\n\n\"This cautious pace seems odd when you consider AI has exploded onto the scene and consumers increasingly have a lot of choice for AI-enabled devices. It\u2019s like a carrot dangled in front of Apple (AAPL) and it only wants to nibble at it, rather than devour the whole thing.\"\n\n\u201cConsumers need a reason to upgrade their phone, otherwise they\u2019re going to stick with their current model given how even the cheapest devices are fairly sophisticated these days. Apple (AAPL) is clearly hoping its AI services will be the catalyst to drive handset upgrades, but it\u2019s going about it in a strange way.\"\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(AAPL)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nIntel (INTC)\n\nIntel (INTC) stock gained 1.3% on Thursday and was trading 1.7% higher in premarket on Friday following a quarterly earnings report which beat fourth quarter expectations, but gave a tepid read for the first quarter of the year.\n\nThe CPU and chipmaker posted adjusted earnings per share of $0.13, above the analyst estimate of $0.12.\n\nRevenue for the quarter came in at $14.3bn, beating consensus estimates of $13.8bn but declining 7% year-on-year. For the full year 2024, it reported revenue of $53.1bn, down 2% year-on-year.\n\nTraders seemed unfazed by Q1 forecasts, which put revenue between $11.7bn and $12.7bn, below the analyst consensus of $12.9bn.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(INTC)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nNovartis (NVS)\n\nDrugsmaker Novartis (NVS) headed higher in premarket trade on Friday, after posting quarterly adjusted net income well above analyst estimates. The increase comes off the back of sales of its heart failure drug, Entresto, and multiple sclerosis drug Kesimpta.\n\nStory Continues\n\nEntrestro, which will lose its patent protection later this year, saw quarterly revenues jump by a third to $2.2bn.\n\nFor Q4, net income rose 26% to $3.9bn. This surpassed analyst consensus of $3.6bn, Reuters reported.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(NVS)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nShell (SHEL.L)\n\nOil major Shell (SHEL.L) was trading 0.8% higher in the morning on Friday, building on gains from the week following its quarterly earnings report.\n\nThe company reported a sharp fall in profits in the fourth quarter but declared another $3.5bn (\u00a32.8bn) share buyback.\n\nAdjusted earnings of $3.66bn in the fourth quarter were down 39% on the $6bn Shell (SHEL.L) posted in the third quarter, according to its latest results. For the year, adjusted earnings were down 16% to $23.7bn, compared to $28.3bn in 2023.\n\nShell said income attributable to shareholders had fallen 78% to $928m in the fourth quarter, down from $4.2bn in previous quarter.\n\nHowever, this figure was higher than the $474m it reported in the same period last year.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(SHEL.L)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nSmiths Group (SMIN.L)\n\nSmiths Group (SMIN.L) was the top riser in the FTSE 100 (^FTSE) on Friday, up more than 14% after the opening bell following news it had responded to activist investor calls to split up its business. The company plans to sell its electronic connectors unit and said it would demerge or offload the detection operation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a new argument that Smiths Group (SMIN.L) should break up as its units would attract higher valuations as individual entities, and the company has demerged businesses in the past,\" Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.\n\n\u201cHowever, Smiths Group (SMIN.L) has historically resisted calls for a full dismantling of its conglomerate structure.

        "headline": "Can This Popular Vanguard Tech ETF Trounce the S&amp;P 500 Again in 2025?",
        "content": "Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have transformed the investing landscape since their 1993 debut, attracting investors with their straightforward approach to diversification. By allowing individuals to buy shares that track entire market indexes or sectors, ETFs eliminate the challenge and risk of selecting individual stocks while keeping costs minimal.\n\nThe technology sector particularly exemplifies the power of ETF investing in the years following the 2008 financial crisis. As digital innovation has fundamentally altered how we communicate, work, and live -- from the rise of social media to the recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI) -- tech-focused ETFs have delivered exceptional returns since the financial crisis while providing investors broad exposure to this transformative industry.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe Vanguard Information Technology ETF(NYSEMKT: VGT) has been a particularly potent investing vehicle since its 2004 debut, turning the digital revolution into market-beating gains. Beyond consistent market outperformance, the fund's rock-bottom expense ratio of 0.10% maximizes investor returns, compared to the industry average of 0.93%.\n\nThe fund's stellar performance in 2024 reinforces its winning strategy. While the S&P 500 posted an exceptional 25% total return (including dividends), the Vanguard Information Technology ETF delivered an even more remarkable 29.3% gain to shareholders.VGT Total Return Level data by YCharts.\n\nCan this popular Vanguard tech ETF outperform yet again in 2025? Let's dig deeper to find out.\n\nMarket outlook\n\nAt the start of the year, Wall Street's consensus projected a roughly 10% total return (including dividends) for the benchmark S&P 500. While a lot has transpired since these projections were made -- Trump has taken office, DeepSeek shook the AI world -- this 10% figure gives us a benchmark to gauge the attractiveness of the Vanguard Information Technology ETF in 2025.\n\nHistorically, the Vanguard Information Technology ETF has averaged a total annual return of 13.7% since its inception 21 years ago. That figure implies the fund should beat out the S&P 500 again in 2025, but a deeper look suggests this year may not be typical for the ETF from a performance standpoint.\n\nPortfolio composition and valuation concerns\n\nAn analysis of the fund's portfolio structure reveals why its historical performance trajectory may shift in the coming year. The fund maintains significant concentration risk, with 45% of its assets allocated to three technology leaders: Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), and Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT).\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhile analysts project robust double-digit revenue growth for both Nvidia and Microsoft in 2025, their current valuations -- with forward price-to-earnings ratios (P/Es) above 30 -- suggest much of this anticipated growth is already reflected in their stock prices.\n\nApple presents additional concerns heading into 2025. The company's recent decision to integrate ChatGPT through an OpenAI partnership across its operating systems marks a departure from its traditional innovation leadership. This strategic pivot toward following rather than setting AI trends could potentially erode Apple's premium market positioning.\n\nGiven these factors -- the elevated valuations of Nvidia and Microsoft, combined with Apple's strategic challenges -- the fund's largest holdings may struggle to deliver the market-beating returns investors have come to expect. This concentration in potentially overvalued assets introduces meaningful risk to the fund's near-term performance outlook.\n\nGrowth catalysts and market dynamics\n\nThe emergence of DeepSeek's cost-effective AI models has sparked debate about the massive AI investments planned by U.S. technology leaders. While these companies continue to commit trillions to AI development, DeepSeek's breakthrough raises questions about the necessity of such extensive capital deployment.\n\nThis development marks a pivotal moment in AI's evolution. Chinese companies have demonstrated their abilities to create capable chatbots without relying on the most advanced semiconductor technology.\n\nHowever, pursuing artificial general intelligence (AGI) still depends heavily on specialized AI processors, a market where Nvidia maintains clear technological leadership. This dynamic creates an intriguing tension between emerging cost-efficient approaches and the continued value of cutting-edge hardware infrastructure.\n\nWhile the U.S. pursuit of AGI should continue driving robust revenue growth for Microsoft and Nvidia, the accelerating pace of Chinese AI development introduces new strategic and competitive risks. This evolving landscape suggests that even market leaders must navigate an increasingly complex technological and geopolitical environment.\n\nInvestment outlook\n\nThe Vanguard Information Technology ETF enters 2025 in unfamiliar territory. Unlike its consistent market-beating performance since the 2008 financial crisis, the fund now faces unique challenges. The AI landscape has grown more complex, with Chinese developments like DeepSeek demonstrating that competitive language models can be built without cutting-edge semiconductor technology.\n\nWhile DeepSeek may ultimately prove less capable than the sophisticated models from Anthropic, Alphabet, and OpenAI -- and the pursuit of AGI will likely continue to require Nvidia's advanced AI processors -- the broader investment thesis has shifted. For the first time in over fifteen years, this widely held Vanguard fund no longer presents the compelling case for outperformance that investors have come to expect.\n\nThis uncertainty doesn't necessarily signal underperformance but suggests a more nuanced risk-reward profile that investors should carefully evaluate against their portfolio objectives.\n\nTaking the long view\n\nWhile the Vanguard Information Technology ETF may face near-term headwinds in 2025, its long-term growth potential remains compelling. Artificial intelligence represents a genuine technological revolution, rather than a passing trend, with its transformative effects already visible across industries and societies.\n\nThe economic impact of AI is expected to be profound, with projections suggesting it could generate trillions in global economic value by 2030. This fundamental shift in the technological landscape makes the Vanguard Information Technology ETF an attractive long-term investment opportunity, even as it navigates temporary uncertainties. The fund's exposure to key players in the AI revolution positions it well to capture substantial value creation over the next decade and beyond.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?
