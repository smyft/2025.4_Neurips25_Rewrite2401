You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their previous performance, and go directly to read 5 Oversold Dividend Stocks To Buy Now.\n\nThe S&P 500 is consistently recording gains this year, having risen for four months in a row. According to Bank of America\u2019s chief global strategist Michael Hartnett, the remarkable returns achieved by the S&P 500 over a short time period have been rare and only occurred ten times since the 1930s. He further said that these returns materialized either during the aftermath of the recession, like the ones in 2009 and 2020, or at the onset of a bubble, similar to the situation experienced in 1999. That said, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), which played a significant role in driving the market rally in 2023, has entered the oversold territory this year. The stock is down by 7.63% year-to-date, facing pressures due to concerns over iPhone sales in China and a fine from the European Union, as reported by Bloomberg.\n\nInvestors are trying to navigate this directionless market, seeking to maximize their returns by making informed decisions. Over the years, dividend stocks have served as a safeguard against market downturns, making them an appealing option in the current environment. When considering investments in dividend stocks, combining dividend yields with dividend growth can be a good strategy. In our article titled 25 Things Every Dividend Investor Should Know, we referred to data from S&P Dow Jones Indices, which analyzed the performance of the S&P 500 High Yield Dividend Aristocrats. The index tracks the performance of high-yield dividend companies within the S&P 500 Composite 1500 with at least 20 consecutive years of dividend growth. The report revealed that between December 31, 1999, and March 31, 2022, the index outperformed its benchmark index by 140 basis points per month. During this period, the index also surpassed the S&P 500 High Dividend Index by 49 basis points per month.\n\nStory continues\n\nOur research also showed that dividend stocks have performed better than other asset classes during inflationary periods. We cited data from Hartford Funds, examining the performance of dividend stocks during decades of the 1940s, 1960s, and 1970s when inflation in the US was at its peak. The report highlighted that during these decades the average market returns were below 10%, and dividends contributed 67%, 44%, and 73% to the market\u2019s returns, respectively. One of the main reasons for this performance of dividend stocks can be attributed to the fact that they have the potential to grow over time. The companies that generate more profit may opt to increase their dividends, remaining more committed to their shareholder obligation. The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) are some of the best dividend stocks in this regard, returning their capital to shareholders consistently for years.\n\nThat said, dividend stocks\u2019 past performance does not guarantee immunity against severe market conditions. During market clampdowns, investors' confidence may decline which triggers widespread selling across various stocks resulting in some becoming oversold. The Relative Strength Index (RSI), introduced by J. Welles Wilder Jr. in 1978, is a technical analysis tool that is used to analyze the speed and change of price movements of a stock. The RSI is calculated based on the average gains and losses over a specific period, typically 14 trading days. However, this period can be adjusted depending on the trader's preference. In this article, we have compiled a list of oversold stocks based on 14-day RSI levels as of March 30. 12 Oversold Dividend Stocks To Buy Now\n\nPhoto by Viacheslav Bublyk on Unsplash\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nFor this list, we used a Finviz stock screener and looked for dividend stocks with a 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) below 40 as of March 30. An RSI below 40 suggests that the stock is oversold. The stocks are ranked in descending order of their RSI. We also mentioned hedge fund sentiment data for these stocks using Insider Monkey's database of 933 hedge funds as of Q4 2023.

        "headline": "Apple's antitrust fight could threaten its search for the next big thing",
        "content": "The Department of Justice antitrust lawsuit against Apple (AAPL) could have major consequences for the iPhone maker\u2019s business segments. If the DOJ wins, the company could be forced to give third-party companies greater access to iPhone features including Apple Wallet, improve compatibility with competing devices, and even allow third-party app stores on iOS.\n\nBut the DOJ will have a difficult time proving that Apple has broken antitrust laws, and even if it does prevail to some degree, the company will likely appeal the case all the way to the Supreme Court.\n\nIn the end, Apple may make some concessions, but the DOJ\u2019s suit is unlikely to significantly uproot the company\u2019s overall business. But that wouldn\u2019t mean Apple is out of the woods. The antitrust action could hold greater dangers for the company than giving users access to different app stores or ending the green-versus-blue text bubble debate.\n\nIt could ultimately hurt the company\u2019s ability to capture the next wave of tech innovation, just as Microsoft\u2019s (MSFT) antitrust suit in the late 1990s gobbled up executives\u2019 resources and cost that company its chance to dominate the smartphone market.\n\nA distraction at the worst time\n\nThe tech industry is in the throes of a massive upheaval thanks to the generative AI explosion. Microsoft, which has invested heavily in ChatGPT developer OpenAI, is now the wealthiest public company in the world by market cap, pushing Apple to second place.\n\nNvidia is riding an incredible wave of success with revenue skyrocketing on sales of its AI chips, and seemingly every company in Silicon Valley and beyond is talking about how it\u2019s implementing generative AI to one degree or another. Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates attends a session at the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos on Jan. 17, 2024. (FABRICE COFFRINI/AFP via Getty Images) (FABRICE COFFRINI via Getty Images)\n\nApple is widely expected to dive into the arena with the debut of its own generative AI capabilities at its WWDC developer conference in June. That\u2019s not all, though. Apple is also working through the continued development and support of its Vision Pro AR/VR headset, which it hopes will serve as a new form of computing.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut antitrust suits are long, time-consuming affairs that can eat up executives\u2019 time, pulling them away from important business decisions.\n\n\u201cIf the company believes that virtual reality is the next generation of computing after the smartphone \u2026 they really need to focus at the C-suite on that,\u201d explained Harvard Business School professor Andy Wu. \u201cBut this case is enough to really substitute their time away from focusing on the future. So that's one risk.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s some precedent for this line of thinking. Microsoft co-founder and former CEO Bill Gates famously blamed the distraction caused by his company\u2019s antitrust battle with the DOJ for its failure to break into, and capture, the smartphone market. Microsoft settled with the Justice Department in 2001, opening up Windows to competing web browsers and services.\n\nMicrosoft eventually launched its own Windows Phone, even going as far as acquiring Nokia for $7.2 billion, but it failed to catch on and the company decided to focus on its cloud business instead.\n\nDeepwater Asset Management managing partner Gene Munster says that while he doesn\u2019t believe the antitrust case will prove to be a major distraction for Apple\u2019s ability to innovate, it\u2019s certainly a threat.\n\n\u201cIf [Apple doesn\u2019t] innovate then they're going to lose and it's not about the DOJ; the DOJ would have been the distraction factor,\u201d he told Yahoo Finance.\n\nApple\u2019s brand damage\n\nA protracted legal battle could also damage Apple\u2019s carefully crafted public image.\n\n\u201cThe question is, how far and how hard is Apple [going to] fight some of this stuff, and in the process, do they risk \u2026 hurting the tremendous goodwill that they have?\u201d said TECHnalysis Research founder and chief analyst Bob O\u2019Donnell. \u201cI think that's something that they need to think about.\u201d Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nApple has built up a powerful following around the world thanks to its top-notch hardware quality, easy-to-use software, and customer service. But a lengthy legal fight and negative headlines could jeopardize that.\n\nYes, Apple is one of the world\u2019s largest electronics companies with a growing services business. And sure, the iPhone is one of the most iconic devices ever built, but consumer sentiment can change overnight, and that could certainly prove problematic for Apple.\n\nThe DOJ\u2019s antitrust suit is still in its earliest stages, and Apple is sure to fight it as aggressively as possible. And while it\u2019s weathered major storms before, including regulatory fights in the European Union, there\u2019s no guarantee the company will come away from this battle unscathed.\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "headline": "Spring Cleaning: 3 Stocks to Say Goodbye to Right Now",
        "content": "Spring is here, and flowers are blooming. You know what that means: Time for a good old-fashioned round of spring cleaning.\n\nWith that in mind, here are three stocks that a panel of Motley Fool contributors are ready to say goodbye to this spring. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWill the rise of AI mean the beginning of the end for Apple?\n\nJake Lerch (Apple): Now, don't get me wrong, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) has enjoyed a great run. It's the second-largest public company in the world for a reason, and I don't think its stock price is about to collapse.\n\nYet however impressive its past performance, what matters to investors is how the company will perform going forward. And that's where I have concerns for Apple.\n\nTo start with, sales of the company's signature product -- the iPhone -- appear to have leveled off after years of growth. In 2023, Apple sold 231 million iPhones -- virtually identical to the number it sold in 2015. Moreover, iPhone revenue appears to have gone flat. The figure last year was $201 billion. That's down from $205 billion in 2022.\n\nYear iPhone Unit Sales iPhone Revenue 2015 231.2 million $155 billion 2016 211.8 million $136.8 billion 2017 216.7 million $141.2 billion 2018 217.7 million $166.2 billion 2019 187.2 million $142.3 billion 2020 196.9 million $137.3 billion 2021 242 million $191.9 billion 2022 232.2 million $205.4 billion 2023 231.3 million $200.5 billion\n\nBut what about Apple services? Won't the company's growing software division lead to its next phase of growth?\n\nPerhaps. Apple's services segment does now account for almost 20% of the company's total revenue. However, software has never been Apple's bread and butter. Indeed, its long-standing policy of bundling its software and hardware has dampened its growth -- dating all the way back to the 1980s, when the company wouldn't license the Mac operating system to other computer makers.\n\nWhat's more, the real question is whether Apple can compete over the long term with companies that have created iconic software, social media, and web apps -- Microsoft (Windows and Office), Alphabet (Google), MetaPlatforms (Facebook), and Amazon (Amazon.com).\n\nStory continues\n\nFinally, the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) raises another question for Apple: What happens to the smartphone business as the use of AI systems keeps expanding? Will anyone want to pay $1,000-plus for a smartphone if everything from TVs to cars to wearables to thermostats is enabled with AI-powered features?\n\nIn short, Apple is at a crossroads. And while I certainly wouldn't bet against the company, I do think investors can find many alternatives with fewer question marks right now -- think Microsoft, Nvidia, and Amazon. And that's why Apple is on my spring cleaning list.\n\nHaving \"AI\" in its name may not be enough to save this stock\n\nWill Healy(C3.ai): At first glance, C3.ai (NYSE: AI) looks like a stock to buy rather than avoid. Given the popularity of generative AI stocks in recent months and the enterprise software company's ability to attract high-profile clients such as the U.S. Army and Baker Hughes, it seems like it should be on a long-term uptrend.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, investors will see serious issues. Though it is successfully attracting enterprise AI clients, the company's strategy appears excessively tied to tech trends. It went by names such as C3 Energy and C3 IoT before it went public in 2020. Those frequent name changes may make investors wonder how committed the company is to its focus on AI.\n\nSecondly, based on its finances, there's some question about whether it can ever become profitable. For the first nine months of its fiscal 2024, C3.ai reported revenue of $224 million, up 15% versus the same period in fiscal 2023. (Its fiscal Q3 ended Jan. 31.)\n\nUnfortunately, its operating expenses (which do not include its $127 million cost of revenue for the period) amounted to $363 million. Consequently, its net loss for the first three quarters of fiscal 2024 came to $207 million.\n\nWorse, C3.ai is not showing any signs it can grow its way out of this problem. For fiscal 2024, it forecasts revenue between $306 million and $310 million, which would amount to a 15% increase at the midpoint.\n\nAs a result, the stock has struggled. It had more than doubled in value at one point last year before a dramatic pullback. Over the past 12 months, the stock is up about 10%, significantly lagging the S&P 500.\n\nFurthermore, it trades at a price-to-sales ratio of 11. That multiple arguably makes C3.ai an expensive stock, particularly considering its financial struggles.\n\nUltimately, investors have numerous choices when it comes to investing in AI. Given the state of its finances, investors should probably consider selling C3.ai and putting their money into a faster-growing AI company that's on a path to sustained profitability.\n\nDon't let greed ruin your stellar investment returns\n\nJustin Pope (Super Micro Computer): I've been bullish about SuperMicroComputer(NASDAQ: SMCI) in the past, and I still like the company over the long term. But Super Micro Computer has risen too high, too fast this year. Shares are more than 1,000% above their 52-week low -- a level of return that the broader market would likely take decades to produce.\n\nIf you're sitting on a multibagger today, considering selling some of your stake would be wise. That doesn't mean there isn't much to like about Supermicro. Its modular server systems are in high demand due to the booming investments in artificial intelligence across the technology sector. The company's growth has accelerated to a triple-digit percentage rate, and management believes revenue will grow by over 200% year-over-year in the next quarter.\n\nBut stocks can be volatile, and the broader market has been running hot. The Nasdaq Composite index is up a smoldering 38% over the past year. Eventually, a pullback could pour cold water on share prices, and investors may start locking in some profits from their big winners. Has any stock run as high as Super Micro Computer? It would be hard to find one that has.\n\nI'm not saying you should sell everything and run for the hills. However, greed can be a powerful emotion that works against investors. If you're sitting on huge gains, consider taking some profits. You can always look to reinvest when the market inevitably cools off.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "headline": "Here's How Much Dividend Income You'd Make by Investing $70,000 in the \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks",
        "content": "You don't buy growth stocks primarily to receive income. Many of these stocks don't pay dividends at all. However, that doesn't mean you can't earn dividend income from growth stocks.\n\nThe biggest growth stocks on the planet right now are the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks. Can you count on sitting back and having dividends pour in with these stocks? Yes -- at least with some of them. Here's how much dividend income you'd make by investing $70,000 in the Magnificent Seven stocks.\n\nA dividend divide\n\nThere's a clear \"dividend divide\" among the Magnificent Seven stocks. Although they all arguably make enough money to pay dividends, only four actually do so.\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) initiated its dividend program in 2003. Since then, the tech giant has increased its dividend every year.\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) technically began paying quarterly dividends decades ago. However, the company ended its dividend program in 1995 and didn't resume distributing dividends until 2012. Like Microsoft, Apple has consistently increased its dividend payout.\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) is perhaps the most surprising dividend stock in the Magnificent Seven. The big chipmaker first declared a quarterly dividend in 2012. Nvidia increased its dividend regularly for several years but has maintained a steady payout since late 2019.\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) is the newest Magnificent Seven dividend payer. The social media company initiated its dividend program earlier in 2024.\n\nAmazon, Alphabet, and Tesla don't currently offer dividends. That could change in the future for two of the three, though. Goldman Sachs analysts predict that Amazon and Alphabet could begin paying dividends, perhaps as soon as this year.\n\nCounting the money\n\nSo how much dividend income could you make by investing $70,000 in the Magnificent Seven stocks? If you bought $10,000 of each stock, the total would be just under $170. The following table breaks down how much in dividends each stock would contribute:\n\nStory continues\n\nStock Dividend Yield Annual Dividend Income Microsoft 0.71% $71.00 Apple 0.56% $56.00 Meta Platforms 0.41% $41.00 Nvidia 0.018% $1.80 Amazon N/A $0.00 Alphabet N/A $0.00 Tesla N/A $0.00 Total $169.80\n\nData source: Google Finance. Calculations by author. N/A = Not Applicable.\n\nOf course, if you were truly seeking dividend income you probably wouldn't buy shares of Amazon, Alphabet, and Tesla. Let's crunch the numbers assuming you invested $70,000 split equally across the four dividend payers in the Magnificent Seven ($17,500 in each stock). The following table shows how much you'd make:\n\nStock Dividend Yield Annual Dividend Income Microsoft 0.71% $124.25 Apple 0.56% $98.00 Meta Platforms 0.41% $71.75 Nvidia 0.018% $3.15 Total $297.15\n\nData source: Google Finance. Calculations by author. N/A = Not Applicable.\n\nWould most income investors be happy with an annual dividend income of less than $300 from an initial investment of $70,000? Probably not.\n\nLimited magnificence\n\nThe magnificence of the Magnificent Seven stocks is limited. None of them offer attractive dividends. The best dividend payer in the group, Microsoft, still has a dividend yield of barely over half of the yield of the S&P 500.\n\nDividends are an afterthought if you're investing in the Magnificent Seven. Buy these stocks for their growth prospects. Many other stocks are more magnificent if you want solid dividend income.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "headline": "Is It Safe to Buy Stocks With the S&amp;P 500 at a Record High? Warren Buffett's Advice Could Save Investors From Costly Mistakes",
        "content": "The S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) advanced 31% over the past year as investors became more confident in a soft landing, a scenario in which the Federal Reserve successfully tames inflation without tipping the economy into a recession. The index currently sits within a percentage point of its record high, but upward momentum has stretched valuations across the stock market.\n\nThe S&P 500 currently trades at 20.9 times forward earnings, a slight premium to the five-year average of 19 times forward earnings, and a substantial premium to the 10-year average of 17.7 times forward earnings. Not surprisingly, some analysts on Wall Street think stocks are due for a correction. JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley have set the S&P 500 with year-end targets of 4,200 and 4,500, respectively, implying a downside of 19% and 14% from its current level.\n\nThose forecasts leave investors with a tough decision. Is it safe to buy stocks with the S&P 500 near its record high? Or is the stock market best avoided until valuations come down? Anyone looking for answers might want to take their cue from Warren Buffett.\n\nWhat investors can learn from Berkshire Hathaway's 13F filings\n\nCEO Warren Buffett reportedly manages about 90% of Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) equity securities portfolio, while deputies Todd Combs and Ted Weschler handle the remainder. Investors can track the stocks the trio buys and sells each quarter by reviewing the Form 13Fs the company files with the SEC.\n\nThe latest filing indicates that Berkshire sold several stocks during the fourth quarter. The company closed its positions in Markel, Globe Life, D.R. Horton, and StoneCo, substantially reduced its positions in Paramount Global and HP, and trimmed its stake in Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). However, Berkshire also bought stocks during the fourth quarter. The company added to its positions in Sirius XM, Occidental Petroleum, and Chevron.\n\nCollectively, Berkshire was a net seller of stocks last year. The company reported more than $40 billion in equity securities sales compared to just $16 billion in purchases. That marks a turnaround from the previous year when Berkshire reported $33 billion in equity securities sales and $68 billion in purchases.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn short, Buffett and his deputies continued to buy stocks throughout 2023 despite rising valuations, but they also moved more cautiously. Investors should follow that example.\n\nThe Warren Buffett blueprint for investing success\n\nOver the years, Warren Buffett has dropped bits of investing advice like breadcrumbs during interviews, editorials, and shareholder letters. In synthesizing that information, the prevalent theme is that Buffett likes to buy understandable businesses that benefit from a durable economic moat, but only when shares trade at attractive prices relative to intrinsic value.\n\nEconomic moats come in different shapes and sizes, but they generally amount to pricing power or cost advantages. For instance, Apple derives pricing power from the brand authority it has built with consumers. Nvidia has pricing power in the superior nature of its artificial intelligence chips. And Visa benefits from cost advantages arising from the size of its payments network. However, an economic moat alone does not qualify a business as a good investment. Investors must also consider its valuation.\n\nBuffett once explained the concept of intrinsic value by quoting economist John Burr Williams: \"The value of any stock, bond, or business today is determined by the cash inflows and outflows -- discounted at an appropriate interest rate -- that can be expected to occur during the remaining life of the asset.\" That quote refers to discounted cash flow analysis, which discounts future earnings back to their present value to estimate what a company is worth.\n\nHow the discounted cash flow calculation works\n\nThe discounted cash flow (DCF) formula looks intimidating on paper. But online calculators can crunch the numbers, so investors only need to familiarize themselves with the inputs. Learning by example is the best strategy. Shown below is a DCF calculation for Apple using this calculator.\n\nCurrent value: The trailing-12-month earnings per share (EPS) or free cash flow (FCF) per share. I used earnings per share of $6.42 over the last 12 months. Discount rate: The return required to make the investment worthwhile. I used the historical return of the S&P 500, which is approximately 10% annually. Some investors prefer the weighted average cost of capital. Growth rate: The anticipated earnings growth rate over a defined period of time. I used the consensus forecast among Wall Street analysts, which says Apple will grow earnings per share at 8.3% annually over the next five years. Growth over: The length of time the growth rate will persist. As mentioned, Wall Street expects Apple to grow earnings per share at 8.3% annually over the next five years. Terminal rate: The anticipated earnings growth rate after the explicit forecast period. This number should align with inflation, but should not exceed gross domestic product growth. Investors typically select a value between 2% and 4%, so I split the difference with 3%. Terminal rate over: The length of time the terminal rate will persist. Investors often assume terminal growth will continue indefinitely, but I used 50 years.\n\nBased on those inputs, Apple is currently worth $115 per share. That means the stock is about 32% overvalued at its current price of $169 per share. However, investors should remember DCF models involve guesswork, and even small changes to the inputs can have a drastic impact on the output.\n\nIt's safe to buy stocks, but the market environment warrants caution\n\nTo summarize, the S&P 500 moved much higher over the past year, and the index currently trades at a material premium to its historical valuation. Even so, Buffett continued to buy stocks throughout the year, including during the fourth quarter. But he also showed more caution compared to the previous year, indicating that worthwhile investments were harder to find.\n\nIn that context, investors can safely purchase stocks in the current market, provided they show similar caution. That means avoiding costly mistakes driven by fear of missing out, and instead limiting purchases to competitively advantaged businesses trading at reasonable valuations.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in S&P 500 Index right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in S&P 500 Index, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and S&P 500 Index wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Warren Buffett said in an interview with CNBC in April 2023 that artificial intelligence (AI) was \"extraordinary.\" However, Buffett quickly added that he didn't \"know if it's beneficial.\"\n\nWhatever the multibillionaire's opinion of AI is, he has already benefited financially from the technology. Buffett has invested $159 billion in these eight AI stocks -- and most of them have been big winners over the last 12 months.\n\n1. Apple\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is by far the biggest AI holding for Buffett. Berkshire Hathaway's stake in the tech giant is worth roughly $156.9 billion. The stock hasn't performed especially well over the last 12 months, though, due to sluggish sales growth.\n\nThat could change soon. Apple is widely expected to unveil its AI strategy at its developer conference and announce new AI functionality for iPhones in June.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nBerkshire owns $1.8 billion in Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) stock. Although Buffett didn't make the original decision to buy the e-commerce and cloud services leader, he's expressed regret for not buying the stock earlier.\n\nAmazon has long been a pioneer in AI, reaping substantial efficiency gains from the technology. The ongoing surge in the adoption of generative AI should provide a big tailwind for its Amazon Web Services cloud platform.\n\n3. Microsoft\n\nIs Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) a Buffett AI stock? Although you won't find it listed in Berkshire's regulatory filings, the answer is a resounding \"yes.\" Berkshire subsidiary New England Asset Management (NEAM) has a stake in Microsoft worth $11.6 million.\n\nMicrosoft has been one of the biggest winners of the AI boom. The company has integrated OpenAI's GPT-4 large language model throughout its product lineup. Microsoft's Azure cloud platform is also enjoying strong growth as customers scramble to build and deploy AI apps.\n\n4. Broadcom\n\nBuffett also owns shares of Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO) thanks to NEAM. The investment firm's position in Broadcom was valued at over $9.5 million at the end of 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nBroadcom is a leading provider of custom AI accelerators and networking software used to scale AI applications. Its new XPU accelerator could claim the record as the biggest chip ever built for a consumer AI company.\n\n5. NXP Semiconductors\n\nNXP Semiconductors(NASDAQ: NXPI) is another AI chipmaker in NEAM's portfolio (which makes it a Buffett stock, albeit indirectly). NEAM owns a stake of $8.9 million in NXP.\n\nAI is everywhere these days -- and that's good for NXP. The company focuses on chips for the automotive, Internet of Things (IoT), mobile, and communications infrastructure markets.\n\n6. Qualcomm\n\nThrough NEAM, Buffett has a position worth $8.3 million in Qualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM). Although Qualcomm hasn't delivered the sizzling gains over the last 12 months that some AI stocks owned by Buffett have, it's still up over 35%.\n\nQualcomm is best known for its technology, which is used in mobile phones. The company is also investing heavily in AI and recently teamed up with several other top tech companies to develop open-source software that allows AI apps to run on any chip.\n\n7. IBM\n\nBerkshire Hathaway once directly owned shares of IBM(NYSE: IBM) but no longer does. However, the tech pioneer remains a Buffett stock due to NEAM's $5 million stake in IBM.\n\nIBM might not be viewed as much of an AI leader now as it once was. The company's Watson platform, though, is used by many companies to harness the power of AI.\n\n8. Alphabet\n\nBuffett admitted publicly a few years ago that he made a mistake by not investing in Google parent Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) earlier. While the tech giant still isn't in Berkshire's portfolio, NEAM owns around $2.5 million worth of Alphabet's shares.\n\nAlphabet has had a couple of public relations embarrassments with its AI efforts. But the company remains one of the leaders in AI development. It's also rumored to be in negotiations with Apple about integrating the Google Gemini AI models with iPhones.\n\nAre these Buffett AI stocks good picks to buy now?\n\nI think that all of these Buffett AI stocks could deliver solid long-term returns. Which are the best picks? I like Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet. In my view, AI will primarily run in the cloud. These three companies operate the largest cloud platforms and should continue to be big winners for years to come.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "headline": "Are Nike, Lululemon, Apple, Tesla, and Starbucks Waving a Red Flag for the Stock Market?",
        "content": "So far, the stock market is having a great 2024, at least when measured by the performance of the major indexes. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite are both up over 9.5% year to date. However, if you dig a little deeper, you see that there is a divergence forming.\n\nHere's why the S&P 500 could keep going up despite this challenge, and how these changing market dynamics could impact your portfolio. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nConsumer-facing companies are vulnerable\n\nThere are plenty of ways to categorize companies. You could do it by sector. Or growth stocks versus value stocks. Or small cap versus large cap. But one often overlooked difference between companies is whether they mainly sell to consumers or businesses. For example, Nvidia and Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) are both big tech stocks. But Nvidia predominantly sells to businesses, while Apple is more consumer-facing.\n\nSome -- though not all -- consumer-facing companies are struggling, while business-facing companies are hitting record highs. The economy as a whole is doing well, but not as well if you look through the lens of the consumer.\n\nThe industrial sector has quietly hit an all-time high, led by surging profits from heavy equipment and special machinery manufactures like General Electric and Caterpillar. Meanwhile, a more consumer-facing company, United Parcel Service, which is one of the largest indusial companies by market cap, is hovering around a three-year low. The divergence within the industrial sector is an allegory for the broader market.\n\nJustifying a premium price\n\nMany companies rely on consumer discretionary spending and brand power to convince consumers to pay up for their products. Starbucks(NASDAQ: SBUX) is much more expensive than coffee and tea from a grocery store. Nike (NYSE: NKE) and Lululemon Athletica (NASDAQ: LULU) charge far more for their shoes and apparel than non-name-brand alternatives. Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) has brought the cost of its cars down, but there are still more affordable options. And Apple charges top dollar for its devices.\n\nStory continues\n\nAll five of these companies are instantly recognizable brands and industry leaders. But all five stocks have been struggling. Starbucks and Nike are within 5% of their 52-week lows. And all five companies have lost considerable value in 2024 compared to strong gains in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite. SBUX Chart\n\nDespite being in different industries, the challenges of these companies are actually quite similar.\n\nDemand problems\n\nNike has been cutting inventory so it is less exposed to slowing consumer demand. Lululemon delivered blowout results, but guidance was light due to a challenging consumer environment that includes concerns about the economy and diverting spending toward services and experiences over goods. Since reporting earnings on March 21, Nike stock is down over 8% and Lululemon is down over 19%.\n\nStarbucks has exhibited impressive pricing power that has offset inflationary impacts and has led to record sales. But cost concerns remain, namely from higher wages and unionization efforts that could hurt its margins. Starbucks is doing well internationally, but a lot of its store growth over the next few years is centered on China, which has been facing a slowdown.\n\nApple and Tesla have been particularly vulnerable to the China slowdown. Apple's growth has slowed in the U.S. and most of its emerging markets, but it's still putting up record results. However, sales have fallen by double-digit percentages in China, which is Apple's second-most-important market outside the U.S. And aside from economic woes, Apple is also facing steep competition from Huawei and others that are aiming to take market share from Apple in China.\n\nTesla has seen its margins collapse in the face of slowing demand and price cuts. It's also facing heated competition in China, its second-largest market, from BYD and other competitors. Meanwhile, legacy automakers like Toyota are having success with hybrid vehicles over pure-play EVs -- challenging Tesla's business model. Earnings are projected to be lower in the next 12 months than the previous 12 months, signaling that Telsa is in store for negative growth over the short term.\n\nA buying opportunity for patient investors\n\nDifferent sectors tend to outperform or underperform the S&P 500 based on the business cycle, valuation, investor sentiment, and other factors. What makes 2024 unique is that many sectors are doing well, but there are major industry-leading companies that tell a completely different story.\n\nThe broader market can keep going up even if consumer-facing companies remain challenged, because businesses are doing well and could accelerate growth if interest rates fall later in the year.\n\nIn most cases, if an industry leader is underperforming it's because it has high exposure to consumer spending and/or China. The investment thesis for Apple, Tesla, Nike, Lululemon, and Starbucks hasn't really changed. Instead, all five stocks are underperforming because these companies don't have the qualities that are driving the widespread rally (artificial intelligence and rising corporate profits from business-to-business sales).\n\nInvestors who think consumers and China will recover over time are getting the chance to buy many great companies on sale. Just be ready for more volatility, and the risk that the narrative could get worse before it gets better.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "headline": "10 Industries with the Highest Number of Quits in the US",
        "content": "In this article, we will look at the 10 industries with the highest number of quits in the US. We have also discussed the great resignation and turnover expectations for 2024. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 5 Industries with the Highest Number of Quits in the US.\n\nThe Great Resignation, characterized by a massive increase in job quits, appears to be drawing to a close, marking the end of a tumultuous period in the workforce. Since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, millions of workers have left their jobs, with astonishing numbers quitting in 2021 and 2022. Anthony Klotz, who coined the term 'Great Resignation,' notes that resignation rates have returned to pre-pandemic levels according to May 2023 data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), indicating a normalization of the job market.\n\nEconomists attribute the decline in resignations to various factors, including economic instability and improved working conditions. The current economic uncertainty has made workers more cautious about quitting, leading to a slowdown in resignation rates. Additionally, many individuals who made significant career changes during the pandemic have settled into new roles, contributing to the decline in quits. Job satisfaction is reportedly at its highest level in nearly four decades, reflecting improved workplace conditions and employer efforts to retain talent.\n\nDespite the overall decline in resignations, certain industries continue to experience high turnover rates, such as healthcare, manufacturing, and construction. While economists declare the Great Resignation officially over, they acknowledge that certain sectors may still struggle to find and retain workers.\u00a0 Currently, healthcare and hospitality are two of the industries in the US that have the biggest labor shortages.\n\nIt is also interesting to note that employers are bracing for increased turnover in the first half of 2024, as revealed by a recent study from Eagle Hill, signaling a potential increase in departures due to faltering confidence in leadership and overall workplace satisfaction. The survey was conducted nationally and pointed to a nearly 6-point decline in worker confidence regarding organizational stability and leadership, coupled with a 2.7-point drop in satisfaction with cultural elements such as connection and recognition. Despite these concerning trends, there's a glimmer of hope as workers exhibit confidence in pay-related matters, with perceptions of compensation and future growth expectations rebounding by 2.5 points in the last quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, as highlighted by iCIMS\u2019 2024 Workforce Report, 51% of surveyed individuals contemplate job changes, primarily driven by salary aspirations. Concurrently, 60% anticipate promotions, with 50% intending to seek new opportunities if promotions elude them. Such data confirms a shift towards prioritizing personal fulfillment over traditional work commitments. Employers are urged to capitalize on internal mobility, evidenced by a 13% decrease in external hires compared to the previous year, signaling opportunities for career growth within organizations.\n\nDespite the optimism displayed by 87% of employees regarding job security, driven perhaps by economic stabilization, workforce strategies demand agility. HR leaders must nurture employee engagement through skill development initiatives, vital for retention and internal advancement. To read more about job security, see 22 Careers with the Best Job Security.\n\nWith an aim to impart education and skills, in 2018, Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT) introduced a groundbreaking education benefit, offering $1-a-day tuition for approximately 30 college degrees. Fast forward to today, Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT) is drastically reducing its degree offerings from 30 to just eight, while expanding short-form certificate programs to over 50 options.\n\nThe revamped program aims to equip employees with in-demand skills like generative AI and data-driven decision making. By doing so, Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT) plans to fill around 100,000 jobs within the next three years, focusing on roles such as software engineering and pharmacy technicians.\n\nWhile some may perceive the reduction in degree options as a limitation, Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT) focuses on the benefits of short-term certificate programs. These programs typically take four months to complete, offering a quicker path to career advancement compared to the six to eight years typically required for a college degree.\n\nOne of the companies with the lowest turnover rates in the world is Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). Currently, the company is strategically expanding its Vision Pro VR headset beyond the US, with recent job listings in countries like Australia, China, and Japan hinting at an imminent global launch. Initially released solely in the US for $3,499, the Vision Pro's international rollout has been eagerly anticipated. Job postings seeking \"Briefing Experience Specialists\" in these markets signify\u00a0 Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u2019s intention to introduce the device to a broader audience.\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u2019s meticulous approach to ensuring a seamless customer experience, especially concerning fitting and prescription lenses, underpinned its initial US-only release. However, the ongoing language expansion and job listings suggest Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u2019s readiness to cater to a global audience. While specific release dates remain undisclosed, these developments strongly suggest that the Vision Pro's reach will extend beyond US shores soon. 10 Industries with the Highest Number of Quits in the US\n\nA construction site featuring a large concrete foundation poured by the cement manufacturing company.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo list the industries with the highest number of quits in the US, we relied on seasonally adjusted data on quit rates by industry from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, as of January 2024.

Mining and Logging\n\nQuits Rate as of January 2024: 1.6%\n\nIn addition to volatile energy prices affecting the oil and natural gas drilling sector, the mining and logging industry in the US is facing high resignation rates due to several factors. One significant reason is increased concerns over workplace safety and environmental sustainability, prompting workers to seek alternative employment in less hazardous or more environmentally conscious sectors. Moreover, technological advancements and automation are reducing the demand for manual labor in these industries, leading to job insecurity and prompting workers to explore new career paths.\n\nTo read more about the dangers involved with jobs in this industry, see the most dangerous jobs in the world.\n\n9. Manufacturing (Durable Goods)\n\nQuits Rate as of January 2024: 1.6%\n\nManufacturing is one of the top industries with the highest number of quits in the US.\n\nLet\u2019s look at some of the reasons why the resignation rate in the industry is high. The nature of manufacturing work often involves physically demanding tasks, long hours, and repetitive duties, leading to dissatisfaction among workers. Secondly, wages in the manufacturing industry may not always be competitive compared to other sectors, prompting employees to seek higher-paying opportunities elsewhere. Thirdly, limited opportunities for career and professional growth can discourage employees from staying long-term.\n\n8. Information\n\nQuits Rate as of January 2024: 1.7%\n\nThe high quit rate in the information industry, especially among technologists, is driven by the rapid evolution of technology that necessitates continuous skill updates, prompting professionals to seek new roles offering better growth prospects. Moreover, intense competition fosters job mobility as individuals pursue higher pay and improved conditions.\n\nAdditionally, the widespread adoption of remote work expands the range of potential employers, granting technologists greater flexibility. These dynamics create an environment where professionals actively explore and capitalize on available opportunities, leading to the industry's increased quit rate.\n\n7. Construction\n\nQuits Rate as of January 2024: 1.8%\n\nConstruction is one ofthe industries that need the most workers. In the US, the industry is facing major challenges, notably a shortage of skilled workers impacting project costs and timelines. Reports suggest over half a million positions need filling, including roles like heavy equipment operators, carpenters, and electricians. This deficit is worsened by factors such as the Great Resignation and a lack of young recruits. Construction companies are exploring solutions like training programs and technology integration. To read more about shortages, see 15 US States With The Highest Labor Shortages.\n\n6. Manufacturing (Non Durable Goods)\n\nQuits Rate as of January 2024: 1.9%\n\nThe manufacturing industry faces several major challenges in its workforce, reflected in alarming statistics. High turnover rates, averaging 39.9% according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, pose a persistent obstacle. Such turnover not only disrupts production but also results in substantial financial losses due to the need for frequent retraining. Moreover, the sector struggles with a critical shortage of skilled workers, with Deloitte projecting over two million unfilled manufacturing jobs by 2025. This scarcity threatens the industry's growth potential, potentially resulting in a $1 trillion loss to the US economy by 2030.\n\nClick here to see the 5 Industries with the Highest Number of Quits in the US.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\nTop 20 Fastest Growing Industries in the Next 5 Years: Predictions 15 Fast-Growing Industries Looking To Hire in the US Top 19 Industries That Are Hiring Right Now\n\nDisclosure: None. 10 Industries with the Highest Number of Quits in the US is originally published on Insider Monkey.",

        "headline": "Smartphone maker Xiaomi switches from Apple to Tesla challenger as its first EV racks up 120,000 orders in 36 hours",
        "content": "Anyone who\u2019s tried a Xiaomi smartphone knows it\u2019s a worthy competitor to the iPhone. Now the question is, will Xiaomi present the same kind of challenge to Tesla as to Apple?\n\nOn Thursday, the Chinese juggernaut launched its first electric vehicle, the SU7 sedan. Billionaire founder and CEO Lei Jun\u2014a household name in China\u2014said at the presentation in Beijing: \"Many people ask me who the Xiaomi SU7 is built for. My answer is, isn't it time for Tesla Model 3 users to upgrade?\"\n\nThe entrant of yet another deep-pocketed rival in China comes at a difficult time for Elon Musk\u2019s carmaker. Last week, Bloomberg reported that Tesla had reduced EV production at its Shanghai factory amid intense competition and sluggish growth in China. Tesla\u2019s market cap has fallen about 30% this year, spurring the company to scrap Musk\u2019s no-advertising mantra. Tesla also faces competition from China\u2019s Warren Buffett-backed BYD, which dethroned it a few months ago as the world\u2019s top EV seller.\n\nOf course, Tesla has already proven itself as a leading EV maker, while Xiaomi is new in the space.\n\n\"In the three years of developing this car, my biggest realization is that making cars is extremely difficult,\u201d Lei said on Thursday. \"Even a giant like Apple gave up on it.\"\n\nIn February, Lei responded to Apple ending its EV project, saying he was \u201cshocked\u201d by the decision. He's cited Apple cofounder Steve Jobs as a primary inspiration to become an entrepreneur.\n\nXiaomi, which also makes smart TVs and home appliances, enjoys Apple-like popularity in China.\n\nBig bet on EVs\n\nLei claimed on Thursday that the SU7, available only in China to start, beats the Tesla Model 3 on 90% of specifications, with Xiaomi needing a few more years to catch up on the rest. He said the sedan had a minimum driving range of 700 kilometers (nearly 435 miles) versus 606 for the Model 3. The base model will sell for under $30,000, cheaper than the Model 3 in China.\n\nStory continues\n\nLei admitted his company will be losing money on every vehicle it sells for the time being. In December, he said that Xiaomi would spend 10 times the labor and investment carmakers usually commit to a new model. But, he added on Thursday, \"Xiaomi has enough cash reserves to cope with any fierce competition in the next five years.\u201d\n\nTime will tell if Lei made the right call by entering the competitive EV market or if it should have veered away as Apple did. Plenty of EV startups once valued in the billions are now struggling.\n\n\"The risk is that they focus too much on the EV space and lose focus on the sectors and products that got them there,\u201d Tu Le, founder of consultancy Sino Auto Insights, told Reuters.\n\nBut Xiaomi is off to a strong start, at least, with the company reporting that it had received 120,000 firm orders for the SU7 in 36 hours, meaning this year\u2019s production capacity is sold out.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "headline": "3 Magnificent Stocks That I'm \"Never\" Selling",
        "content": "When I buy a stock, I try to remind myself that I am buying a small part of a business and that I intend to hold my stocks for the long term. Warren Buffett famously said that his favorite holding period is forever. While that's aspirational more than anything, it's an important reminder that success in investing comes from identifying great businesses and then letting them compound over decades.\n\nWhile some stocks in my portfolio have a lot more to prove to stay there forever, there are some that I can't imagine myself selling. These businesses have long track records and competitive advantages that should pave the way for bright futures. As the saying goes, \"Never say never.\" Yet with these stocks, I'm as close to never selling as one can be.\n\nCostco\n\nEvery time I am struggling to find parking or waiting in the long (but efficient) line to check out, I ask myself why I don't own more Costco Wholesale(NASDAQ: COST) stock. While most of my fellow shoppers are likely not having the same thought, we're all there to take advantage of the bulk quantities and low prices. History tells us that this business model has been wildly successful with Costco shares gaining more than 81,000% since its IPO.\n\nCostco ended its fiscal 2024 second quarter (ended February 2024) as the third-largest global retailer and the 12th-largest company in the Fortune 500, with 874 locations worldwide. Its membership model works well. More than 92% of Costco members renew their membership and the company brought in nearly $5 billion in membership fees in the past 12 months.\n\nThe low prices keep customers coming in the door, and because Costco sells fewer items than its competitors and turns its inventory over very quickly, it can sometimes even sell items before they need to be paid for. This helps cash flows and reduces expenses.\n\nAmazon\n\nIf there's a retailer that comes first to mind for me other than Costco, it has to be Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN). I don't think I am alone in finding myself shopping there before almost anywhere else. Over the trailing 12 months, Amazon stock is up 82%. However, during the market slump of 2022, the company fell nearly 50% as it struggled to get its finances back in order following the massive distribution build-out necessitated by the pandemic surge in orders.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon is certainly back on track and ready to reaccelerate its growth. In 2023, Amazon grew revenue by 12% but the more impressive results were further down the income statement. Operating income increased by 202% and net income grew by 1,226%. These results were driven by a recovery in the e-commerce business, which finally turned the corner after its 2022 struggles. It's also worth remembering that Amazon Web Services (AWS) remains the leader in cloud infrastructure and it grew its revenue by 13% in 2023.\n\nApple\n\nConsumer electronics giant Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) has been in the news lately for all the wrong reasons. Finding itself increasingly under the microscope of federal antitrust investigations, the stock has fallen 12% over the past three months. This news is certainly worth watching, but it will take years to play out and the rather modest decline in Apple's share price suggests the market's level of concern is less severe than some of the headlines indicate.\n\nTaking a step back, it's important to remember that Apple is still a ubiquitous brand around the world, and especially within the United States. Known for its iPhone and other consumer electronic devices, Apple is slowly becoming a software company. Apple now has an installed base of more than 2.2 billion devices.\n\nThis creates an ecosystem of apps and subscription services that provide a high-margin income stream for the company. In the most recently reported quarter, services revenue (which is where all the subscription products are reported) grew by 11% to $23 billion. This represents 19% of total revenue, up from 18% in the year prior.\n\nWhy I'm \"never\" selling\n\nAre there scenarios in which I might sell these companies? Sure, anything is possible. However, these three businesses are so competitively advantaged and are still growing so impressively at their large scale, that it's difficult to envision a scenario where they wouldn't warrant a spot in my portfolio. Investing can be as simple or as complicated as you want it to be. In my mind, buying and owning these three stocks is about as simple as investing can be.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Costco Wholesale right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Costco Wholesale, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Costco Wholesale wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "headline": "Better \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock: Apple or Tesla?",
        "content": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" have delivered outstanding returns to investors in recent years, and they continue to outperform. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF is up 19% year to date, beating the Nasdaq Composite's return of 9.6%.\n\nBut not all seven stocks are up this year. Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) and Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) are down 12% and 27%, respectively. Nonetheless, they have tremendous brand power in their respective markets, and neither will stay down forever. So now is a good time to compare their growth potential to see which offers more upside from here.\n\nApple\n\nApple stock rose 43% over the last three years, but it has been weighed down by market share losses for the iPhone in China. The nation generates 21% of Apple's operating profit. The company was also hit by an antitrust lawsuit by the Department of Justice in March, but that's not as concerning for investors as the slowing product revenue growth.\n\nDespite increasing competition in China, iPhone revenue grew 6% year over year in the quarter ending in December 2023, with management giving credit to a record number of people upgrading.\n\nBut it will be challenging for iPhone sales to grow much faster over the long term. The global marketing intelligence firm IDC forecasts smartphone unit shipments will increase by just 2.6% on an annualized basis through 2027.\n\nNonetheless, one opportunity that management is excited about is selling more devices in the enterprise market. This could be a ripe market for its new Vision Pro headset that launched in February. Top companies like Walmart and Nike are investing in Vision Pro and learning ways to bring the device's spatial computing abilities to their employees.\n\nThe most important growth driver for Apple is increasing the active installed base of devices, which now exceeds 2.2 billion. The Vision Pro could expand this base in the years to come, and importantly, it could help drive higher spending on apps and subscriptions and other high-margin services. Earnings per share grew 16% year over year last quarter, driven by share repurchases and higher margins from services revenue.\n\nStory continues\n\nWall Street analysts forecast Apple's earnings will grow at an annualized rate of 9%\u00a0over the long term. Assuming the stock's price-to-earnings ratio stays the same, that would lead to a return of at least 50% by 2029.\n\nTesla\n\nTesla is facing similar headwinds. Chinese electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers are gaining market share, while rising interest rates are making it more expensive for people to finance a new car this year. Revenue grew 19% in 2023 but is expected to slow to an increase of 12% in 2024.\n\nThe company shouldn't be down for long. The EV market is expected to grow 23% on an annualized basis through 2033, according to Precedence Research. In 2025, Wall Street analysts predict that revenue growth will reaccelerate to nearly 20%.\n\nTesla has several advantages: a large charging-station network, a sophisticated smartphone app, and investments in artificial intelligence (AI). The investments in AI are not only important for self-driving capabilities but could also help boost efficiency and profits through the use of robots in its factories.\n\nIt is already one of the most profitable automakers in the world, generating a significantly higher margin than any of the top U.S. manufacturers, but it's not done improving margins. The company is transitioning to its next-generation manufacturing process that is designed to reduce costs, which could lead to higher margins in a stronger sales environment.\n\nThe tailwind for EV sales and Tesla's ability to crank out more vehicles at a profit is why analysts expect the company's earnings to grow at an annualized rate of 15%. This would be enough to potentially double the stock price over the next five years.\n\nWhich stock should you buy?\n\nIf you're looking for the stock that has more upside potential over the next decade, I believe Tesla is the better choice.\n\nApple is a great business, but the smartphone market is further along the global adoption curve than are EVs, which make up a small share of annual car sales. As Tesla continues to drive down costs and release cutting-edge new models like the Cybertruck, the stock could be a rewarding investment.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "headline": "Forget Apple: I Think This Stock Should Replace It in the \"Magnificent Seven\"",
        "content": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" stock club is almost a year old now, and some of the predictions that originally inspired it are playing out as expected. The \"baby bubble\" that Bank of America analyst Michael Hartnett foreshadowed in May 2023 is losing some air.\n\nI'm looking at you, Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) and Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL).\n\nThe electric vehicle pioneer and the iPhone maker have underperformed the S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) index since the term Magnificent Seven entered Wall Street's lexicon. In fact, Apple investors have lost money on the stock since Hartnett first used the classic Western movie title in a public report.\n\nThey are still business giants with popular products and trendsetting market footprints. Apple holds on to its trendsetting status by sheer scale -- not many stocks can claim a $2 trillion market cap, after all.\n\nYet it might be time someday soon to rethink the Magnificent Seven components. Apple can regain its seat with another round of game-changing innovations and unheard-of product ideas (the Vision Pro headset probably won't do that job in 2024).\n\nAnd I think it's time to give the crypto market a seat at the Magnificent table. History suggests -- supported by planned technical upgrades to leading cryptocurrency systems -- that another massive price surge is coming up soon. To shrug off this incoming surge as if nothing is happening would be a big mistake.\n\nThat's why I'd like to print a Magnificent Seven membership card for Coinbase Global(NASDAQ: COIN), North America's leading crypto exchange and digital assets promoter.\n\nCoinbase is a big deal in 2024: Here's why\n\nThe Magnificent Seven combine amazing innovation and financial might. They dominate large-scale global markets with pioneering technologies and robust investment in research and development (R&D). As undisputed leaders in their fields, their significant impact on market indexes and clear growth trajectories can shape the future economy.\n\nStory continues\n\nCoinbase fits that description to a T. In fact, I would argue that the crypto wrangler's growth trajectory and R&D spending leave Apple far behind.\n\nThe company stands at the heart of the cryptocurrency revolution, perfectly placed to capitalize on these upcoming industry milestones:\n\nWith the upcoming Bitcoin(CRYPTO: BTC) halving, historical trends hint at a potential uptick in market activity, drawing attention across the cryptocurrency landscape. This event, along with Ethereum's (CRYPTO: ETH) stepwise upgrades toward a more scalable network, signals a pivotal moment for blockchain technologies. The growing interest in Web3, with its focus on privacy, decentralized finance, and a more user-centric internet, further highlights the sector's potential for expansion. These innovations should generate increased market activity and broader investor interest over time. As a key platform offering access to important Web3 cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Polkadot(CRYPTO: DOT), Coinbase will undoubtedly benefit from this trend. And the introduction of Bitcoin spot-price exchange-traded funds marks a significant leap toward integrating cryptocurrencies into the mainstream financial ecosystem. These developments not only underscore the market's maturity but also widen the investor base, channeling more transactions through platforms like Coinbase. Old-school banks are not ready to offer crypto transactions or digital wallets yet, giving Coinbase a huge head start in a digital economy.\n\nIn this rapidly evolving landscape of digital assets, Coinbase is strategically positioned to leverage the anticipated growth and increased adoption of cryptocurrencies. These technological advancements and regulatory milestones set the stage for an intense crypto drama over the next couple of years.\n\nWhy Coinbase belongs in the stock market elite\n\nGame-changing success is never easy, and Coinbase also faces many difficult challenges.\n\nThe regulatory rule book can change in a heartbeat, perhaps moving in different directions across various countries. The real-world pricing effects of Bitcoin halvings have been predictable so far, but there's no certainty that the next one will unleash the same results. Quantum computing might break the encrypted security model of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other leading cryptocurrencies, forcing a brand-new technical design in the long run.\n\nI could go on, but you get the picture: Coinbase's near-term and long-term success could be quite likely, but I can never call it \"guaranteed.\"\n\nBut that's why they play the game, right?\n\nOne investor's best idea can be another's darkest nightmare, and the price of any stock or cryptocurrency is negotiated to settle their differences of opinion. In the long run, the underlying business proves who's right and who's wrong. And in this case, I think Coinbase's growth prospects should lead to impressive shareholder gains in 2024 and beyond.\n\nAnd Coinbase will do it in a market-defining way with a heavy dose of innovation. That makes it a robust \"Magnificent\" candidate, ready to step in if and when Apple misplaces its membership card.\n\nAdding Coinbase to the Magnificent Seven vernacular just before the crypto market takes off again could make Wall Street analysts look like prophetic geniuses for a while. So move over, Apple, I think it's time to hand that seat over to Coinbase -- at least for a while.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Coinbase Global right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Coinbase Global, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Coinbase Global wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "headline": "Which \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks Are Attracting More of the Big Money?",
        "content": "When most people buy a company's shares, it doesn't affect the stock's overall momentum very much. Individual investors are small fish in a big ocean. But there are some big fish whose moves can significantly impact a stock's momentum.\n\nInstitutional investors include large organizations such as investment firms, insurers, and pension funds. They're sometimes called the \"big money\" because of the massive size of their investments.\n\nAs you might imagine, institutional investors own major stakes in the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks. That's to be expected since these are some of the biggest companies in the world. But which Magnificent Seven stocks are attracting more of the big money?\n\nThe biggest winners\n\nRoughly 65.5% of Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) shares are owned by institutional investors. The big money has moved into the chipmaker more than any other Magnificent Seven stock.\n\nNasdaq's data shows that 2,202 institutional holders have increased their positions in Nvidia based on the latest round of regulatory filings, and another 1,540 decreased their positions in the stock. Although 112 institutional investors exited their positions in Nvidia, 436 initiated new stakes.\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) trails close behind Nvidia. Nasdaq reports that 2,545 institutional investors have increased their positions in Amazon, compared to 1,852 who have decreased their positions. Another 440 initiated new positions in the stock, with 119 fully selling their positions.\n\nLarge investors have also flocked to Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL). Between the Google parent's class A and class C shares, 3,877 institutional investors increased their positions in the stock, while 3,514 decreased them. According to Nasdaq, 758 institutional investors have initiated new positions in Alphabet, compared to 201 who have exited their positions.\n\nWhy is the big money flowing to Nvidia, Amazon, and Alphabet? The generative artificial intelligence (AI) boom is almost certainly the top reason.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia's GPUs are the gold standard for training and running AI apps, and Amazon and Alphabet operate cloud platforms where organizations can deploy generative AI apps. Alphabet also has a large language model (Gemini) that ranks among the most powerful in the world.\n\nMiddle of the pack\n\nTwo other Magnificent Seven stocks are in the middle of the pack for institutional investor interest. Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) and Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) have attracted a lot of big money, but not to the same extent as Nvidia, Amazon, and Alphabet.\n\nNasdaq's latest numbers show that 1,951 institutional investors have recently increased their positions in Meta, versus 1,503 who decreased their positions. New stakes have been initiated by 418 institutional investors, compared to 108 who exited their positions in the stock.\n\nTesla's institutional ownership is lower than the other Magnificent Seven members. However, 1,627 institutional investors recently increased their stakes in the electric-vehicle maker -- well above the 1,243 who decreased their positions. Also, 336 institutional investors opened new positions in Tesla, with only 140 completely selling their stakes.\n\nThe bottom two\n\nThis leaves Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) and Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) as the bottom two. The number of institutional investors increasing their positions in Microsoft topped the number decreasing their positions by only a narrow margin -- 2,492 to 2,431. The story was worse for Apple, with 2,571 big investors decreasing their positions in the stock, compared to 2,143 increasing their positions.\n\nHowever, there was some good news for these two tech giants. New positions for Microsoft outgained sold-out positions by 422 to 99. There was a similar ratio for Apple with 396 new positions and 77 sold-out positions.\n\nShould you follow the big money?\n\nInvesting in the same stocks that institutional investors are buying can sometimes be smart. The big money flowing in can push share prices higher.\n\nKeep in mind, though, that any data you see about institutional buying and selling reflects past transactions. Institutional investors could have recently soured on a stock they were bullish about previously.\n\nAll of the Magnificent Seven stocks face risks. Valuations are high for some of them, notably including Nvidia and Microsoft. Growth is slowing for Apple and Tesla, and competition is intense for all seven.\n\nHowever, I think each Magnificent Seven stock has solid long-term prospects. Even if you're a small investor, you could make your own version of big money from any of them if you buy and hold.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "headline": "Will Warren Buffett Sell More Apple Stock Because of the DOJ Antitrust Lawsuit -- and Should You?",
        "content": "Warren Buffett has been a big fan of Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) in recent years. However, some might think he's not as enthusiastic about the stock as he used to be. In the fourth quarter of 2023, Berkshire Hathaway trimmed its position in the tech giant.\n\nThis transaction was made before the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) announced that it, along with 16 state and district attorneys general, were suing Apple because the company allegedly violated antitrust laws. Will Buffett sell more Apple stock because of the DOJ antitrust lawsuit -- and should you?\n\nWhy the DOJ is suing Apple\n\nU.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland said in the press release announcing the DOJ lawsuit, \"Consumers should not have to pay higher prices because companies violate the antitrust laws.\" He added, \"We allege that Apple has maintained monopoly power in the smartphone market, not simply by staying ahead of the competition on the merits, but by violating federal antitrust law.\"\n\nHow does the DOJ think Apple is violating antitrust laws? The department's complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey listed several specific allegations against Apple, including that the company:\n\nBlocked iPhone apps that would make it easier for consumers to switch to other smartphone platforms. Blocked the development of mobile cloud streaming services that would allow consumers to play video games without having to purchase costly smartphone hardware. Excluded messaging apps on iPhones that work well across multiple smartphone platforms. Limited the functionality of rivals to the Apple Watch. Limited rival digital wallets by preventing apps from allowing users to tap to pay.\n\nApple disputes all of the DOJ's allegations. The company responded, \"This lawsuit threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets.\" Apple also said, \"We believe this lawsuit is wrong on the facts and the law, and we will vigorously defend against it.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nWill Buffett now sell more Apple stock?\n\nCould Buffett sell additional shares of Apple because of the DOJ lawsuit? Sure. Will he do so? I doubt it.\n\nBuffett has stood by some of his favorite companies in the past that faced antitrust scrutiny. For example, European Union and U.S. antitrust regulators have investigated Coca-Cola. However, Berkshire Hathaway didn't sell any of its position in the food and beverage company.\n\nMore importantly, Buffett told Berkshire Hathaway shareholders at their annual meeting last May that Apple was \"a better business\" than any others that the conglomerate owned. I don't think the DOJ's allegations would shift his view, especially so quickly.\n\nAnd maybe, just maybe, Buffett didn't decide to sell Apple shares in Q4 after all. One of Berkshire's other two investment managers could have made the recent sale. The sale of roughly 10 million Apple shares could also have come from Berkshire subsidiary General Reinsurance's portfolio, which Buffett doesn't directly control.\n\nShould you sell Apple stock?\n\nI think there are some legitimate reasons to consider selling Apple stock. The company's growth has slowed considerably. Its valuation is arguably too steep in light of this sluggishness, with shares trading at a forward earnings multiple of 26x.\n\nHowever, it's way too soon to sell because of the DOJ lawsuit, in my view. Apple will almost certainly mount a strong defense against the antitrust allegations. The lawsuit could be more of a distraction than anything else.\n\nI also believe there's a compelling reason to hold on to Apple stock. In February, Apple CEO Tim Cook stated that the company is \"investing significantly\" in generative AI. He also said, \"Later this year, I look forward to sharing with you the ways we will break new ground in generative AI, another technology we believe can redefine the future.\"\n\nThe company's annual developers conference is scheduled for June 10 through 14. Like many others, I expect Apple will reveal its artificial intelligence (AI) strategy at this conference.\n\nThe DOJ antitrust lawsuit will likely take years to play out. Apple could have big AI news on the way soon. I intend to hold on to my shares of the tech giant. I suspect that Buffett will too. And I think that any investor who sells before Apple reveals its AI strategy could regret doing so.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "headline": "16 Easiest Countries to get a Residence Permit",
        "content": "In this article, we will take a look at 16 Easiest Countries to get a Residence Permit. You can skip our detailed analysis and go directly to the 5 Easiest Countries to get a Residence Permit.\n\nThe advantages of international mobility and a second country where one could live and work has gained much prominence over the years. While immigration and citizenship laws across countries have become friendlier (check out our article on 20 Most Immigrant Friendly Countries In The World), acquiring citizenship or permanent residency requires substantial time-- other than for direct citizenship by investment programs-- and energy. However, another way to live and work in a country can be easily obtained through a residence permit.\n\nResidence Permit: An Overview\n\nA residence permit is basically a document that provides the holder a right to live in a specific country for a specific period of time. The residence permit allows one to live, buy property, cross border, do business, take advantage of medical facilities, and enroll in educational institutions, among others. There are multiple ways of getting a residence permit, which includes marriage, work, study, or investment. The need for international diversification in terms of both human force and foreign direct investment has propelled countries to recognize the need for making special provisions for investors, businessmen and highly qualified and skilled individuals.\n\nIt is thus, no wonder that the issuance of residence permit have registered an increase over the years. In European Union countries, for instance, 3.7 million first residence permits were issued in 2022 to non-EU citizens, a 26% increase (+753445 permit) from 2021. While there are various ways to obtain a residence permit -- with \u201cEmployment Reasons\u201d taking the larger share (42%) of all first residence permits for EU countries in 2021 -- the investment route (Golden Visa) is by far the easier and quicker option.\n\nThe global demand for investor visas have sustained an upward trend with more than 165,000 people opting for them from the US, UK, Canada, and EU countries during the years 2008-2022. One of the popular investor visas include the US EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program that has been operating for more than 30 years. From 2010-2019, the US approved 81,125 investor visas, which is higher than the combined visas issued by Canada, UK, and Portugal. A rise in the trend for European Golden Visas have also been noted. Greece, for example, recorded a 63% increase in the demand for their residence permit programs\u2014from January to May 2023, 3,900 Golden Visa applications had been submitted as compared to 1,444 in 2022. Canada, through their Start-Up Visa, also allowed 175 new permanent residents in August, 2023, a 29.6% increase from July, 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nDeveloped Countries: A Prosperous Investment Avenue\n\nDeveloped countries like the US, Canada and EU states have prosperous economies that foster investment. America is the world\u2019s largest national economy and a global leader in trade. Home to some of the top companies in the world like Google (NASDAQ: GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ: META) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: APPL) etc., the US investment environment is bound to attract investors and entrepreneurs. Other regions around the world, like Europe, can also boast of growing economies. With a population of about 743.5 million in 2022, twice that of the US, Europe is home to not just a large number of people but also hosts some of the largest economies in the world. Germany, for example had a GDP of $4.26 trillion in 2021, fourth worldwide with regard to nominal GDP. The 27 country European Union economic block accounts for about 14% of the world\u2019s total trade in goods. The total value of goods and services produced in the region also amounted to \u20ac14.5 trillion in 2021. Given such statistics, the proliferation of many top-notch multinational companies like Google (NASDAQ: GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ: META) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: APPL) etc. into the area is not surprising.\n\nGoogle (NASDAQ: GOOG), for instance, just recently cemented their European AI investments by announcing a \u20ac25M (US$26.98m) investment that is geared towards improvement in AI skills across the region. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: APPL) on the other hand, invested an additional \u20ac1 billion to expand Silicon Design Centre, earlier last year. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), has also made a recent commitment to expand their cloud infrastructure to meet the demand in Europe.\n\nLet's now head over to the list of 16 Easiest Countries to get a Residence Permit. 16 Easiest Countries to get a Residence Permit\n\n16 Easiest Countries to get a Residence Permit\n\nMethodology\n\nIn order to compile our list of 16 Easiest Countries to get a Residence Permit, we base our method on residence permit received by investment as the easiest way. For this we first select Residency Programs being offered and then pick out the popular or leading Residency by Investment Programs by scouring web as well as our article. We then look at their minimum cost and application processing time and rank them according to the lowest cost and shortest time period. We take a weighted average for the two metrics, with a higher weight (0.6) allotted to cost and the lower to time (0.4). We present our list in a descending order of rank.\n\nNote: The figures for the approximate US Dollar amounts are based on the current exchange rate and are therefore subject to change.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that uses a consensus approach to identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The website tracks the movement of corporate insiders and hedge funds. Our top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 stock index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). So, if you are looking for the best stock picks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.\n\n16 Easiest Countries to get a Residence Permit\n\n16. Malta\n\nMinimum Investment Cost Rank: 7\n\nMinimum Application Process Time Rank: 22\n\nInsider Monkey weighted Average: 13\n\nOne of the popular countries for investor looking to either gain a residency or citizenship, Malta is also one of the easiest countries to get a residence permit. An economically and politically sound country, the country has much to offer investors. The high quality of life to tax advantages, all have contributed to the country\u2019s popularity for residency and investment schemes. According to the requirements of the program, the investor must have at least \u20ac500,000 (approximately US $545,000) worth of assets, \u20ac150,000 (approximately US $163,500) of which should be invested in liquid financial assets. In addition, other stipulations of the program demand property acquisition or lease as well as economic contribution to Maltese economy and donation to a non-governmental organization. Permanent residency is obtained immediately after the application process is complete, which takes about 6-8 months.\n\n15. Costa Rica\n\nMinimum Investment Cost Rank: 6\n\nMinimum Application Process Time Rank: 23\n\nInsider Monkey weighted Average: 12.8\n\nCosta Rica is yet another of the countries that provides easy access to residence permit. With only a US $150,000 investment-- in either property or business -- under the Investor Visa Program, one can find a way to settle down in the country. Forestry projects, however, requires only $100,000 investment. The initial residence permit issued is for two years which is then also renewable, provided the investor maintains the investment. The application process time is a bit higher than other programs, taking about 9 months.\n\n14. Cyprus\n\nMinimum Investment Cost Rank: 13\n\nMinimum Application Process Time Rank: 11\n\nInsider Monkey weighted Average: 12.2\n\nWhile searching for a country where the residence permit can be obtained easily, Cyprus would appear as a viable option. Not only is the minimum investment choice modest, \u20ac300,000 (approximately $327,000) in various types of investments such as property, business, fund, and securities, but the time taken to process the whole application is among the fastest (2 months).\n\n13. Malaysia\n\nMinimum Investment Cost Rank: 9\n\nMinimum Application Process Time Rank: 15\n\nInsider Monkey weighted Average: 11.4\n\nEasy and efficient, Malaysia\u2019s My Second Home Program grants its applicants a 10-year multiple entry visa, which is also renewable. Under this scheme the investor has the choice to pick from three options of investment with different outlay for each. The minimum investment (known as the Silver Tier) corresponds to MYR 500,000 (approximately US $230,000) to be deposited in a Malaysian bank. The tile for application to process is 3-6 months.\n\n12. Canada\n\nMinimum Investment Cost Rank: 1\n\nMinimum Application Process Time Rank: 26\n\nInsider Monkey weighted Average: 11\n\nCanada\u2019s Start-Up Visa Program is not only the best Golden Visa program that has been attracted many an investors, but is also one of the easiest for getting a residence permit. This is primarily due to the non-existent cost of the program. Here the applicant is not required to make an investment themselves but can provide backing of accredited external investors. A C$200,000 (approximately US $148,000) commitment from a designated Canadian venture capital funds, a C$75,000 (approximately US $55,500) commitment from part of a designated Canadian angel investor groups, or a confirmation that the start-up is part of a designated Canadian business incubator program are the different options available. The application process time however, is somewhat higher in comparison to other applications.\n\n11. Panama\n\nMinimum Investment Cost Rank: 5\n\nMinimum Application Process Time Rank: 19\n\nInsider Monkey weighted Average: 10.6\n\nFor people wishful to seek residence in Panama through a quick and easy way of investment, have the choice of two different visas; their Golden Visa known as the Qualified Investor Visa and their Active Investor Visa. Under the qualified investor visa the minimum investment amounts to US $100,000 in a company that has a forest registry with the Ministry of Environment. This will allow a temporary residence of two years and the application processing time is 4 months for the forestry application. Panama also offers an Active Investor Visa known as Panama\u2019s Business Investor Residency Permit. To qualify for this scheme this investor must invest US $160,000 in a new or existing business in Panama, creating at least five full-time jobs for Panama citizens and where the investor is involved on a daily basis with the business.\n\n10. Spain\n\nMinimum Investment Cost Rank: 16\n\nMinimum Application Process Time Rank: 2\n\nInsider Monkey weighted Average: 10.4\n\nA hot-spot for most expats, tourists and investors, Spain\u2019s Golden Visa Program is set to attract foreign direct investment into the country whilst creating ease and efficiency for the investors. They have the choice to select one of the four available investment options which includes property investment, bank deposit, business and bond investment. The lowest possible investment calls for a \u20ac500,000 outlay (approximately US $545,000) in real estate on the open market. The application process is completed in about a month after which the investor is granted a temporary residence permit.\n\n9. Greece\n\nMinimum Investment Cost Rank: 10\n\nMinimum Application Process Time Rank: 11\n\nInsider Monkey weighted Average: 10.4\n\nEurope\u2019s one of the most popular Golden Visas, Greece provides the investors with an opportunity to make investments in various forms of avenues, ranging from as low an investment as \u20ac250,000 (approximately US $272,000) in the purchase of real estate, to as high as \u20ac800,000 (approximately US $872,000) in either corporate or government bonds. The residence permit can be renewed after every five years. The application processing time amounts to 2-4 months.\n\n8. Mauritius\n\nMinimum Investment Cost Rank: 4\n\nMinimum Application Process Time Rank: 11\n\nInsider Monkey weighted Average: 6.8\n\nPeople wishful of gaining easy residency permit might divert their attention to Mauritius\u2019 Residency by investment programs. In the Permanent Residency program for investors, a minimum outlay of US $375,000 in a designated real estate project is required. Upon applications approval which is about 2-3 months, the investor is eligible for permanent residency permit which is valid for 20 years and also renewable as long as the investment is maintained. For those whom this figure might seem a bit steep, another less costly option\u2014the Active Investor Visa-- is also available whereby, by investing US $50,000 in a Mauritius business, a person can get residency permit. The residence permit is renewable upon expiry, contingent upon the business meeting certain performance standards.\n\n7. Italy\n\nMinimum Investment Cost Rank: 10\n\nMinimum Application Process Time Rank: 2\n\nInsider Monkey weighted Average: 6.8\n\nFor investors Italy can not only become a lucrative choice for investment due to the large EU market, but can also become one of the easiest countries to get a residence permit. There are various investment options with varying amounts required, but the minimum one demands a \u20ac250,000 (approximately US $272,000) in innovative start-ups. The country provides residence permit after 1-2 months that are needed to process the application.\n\n6. Portugal\n\nMinimum Investment Cost Rank: 10\n\nMinimum Application Process Time Rank: 2\n\nInsider Monkey weighted Average: 6.8\n\nAnother European favorite Golden Visa Program, Portugal is among the easiest countries for getting a residence permit, providing investors with a wide array of choices. From among them the minimum amount calls for an investment of \u20ac200,000 (approximately US $218,000) in support of an artistic production or maintenance and recovery of natural cultural heritage in a low population density area. The application is usually processed in 4-15 months and gives the investor the right to reside, work, and study in the country.\n\nClick to continue reading and see our 5 Easiest Countries to get a Residence Permit.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n20 European Countries with the Best English Accent 31 European Countries That Offer Citizenship by Descent 20 Best Countries for Migration by Investment\n\nDisclosure: None. 16 Easiest Countries to get a Residence Permit is originally published on Insider Monkey.",

If you want to skip our discussion on growth investing, check out 5 Best Growth ETFs To Buy Now.\n\nWhen interest rates went up in 2023, things changed. Companies had to rethink their plans and prioritize financial resilience over mere growth. Despite two years of interest rate increases causing some disruptions, the global economy has stayed strong regardless of persistent inflation. Developed economies in the West might see ongoing lower inflation as they move from a slow start to an economic recovery later in the year. Even though interest rates rose quickly in 2022 and 2023, many developed countries continued to grow, showing signs of strain only recently. For 2024, Invescopredicts a slight global economic slowdown, especially during the first half of the year. The United States has been resilient compared to the slowing growth in the eurozone and the UK. However, Invesco expects this slowdown to be short-lived as monetary policy adjusts to falling inflation. The firm believes that major central banks in developed countries have likely finished hiking interest rates and will start cutting them as growth slows and inflation calms down. This should help the economy recover towards normal growth in the second half of 2024 as people's wages rise due to lower inflation.\n\nDuring economic downturns, value stocks, which are generally cheaper than growth stocks, often suffer significant declines due to investor concerns. However, they tend to perform well as the economy begins to recover. Interestingly, the rebound of value stocks following the COVID-19 pandemic was not as strong as expected. This could be because investors in 2023 anticipated a recession that did not occur. Additionally, the anticipated fiscal spending in 2024 from government acts like the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, CHIPS Act, and Inflation Reduction Act could boost sectors like finance and industrials. On the other hand, the recovery in 2023 also revived growth stocks following the downturn in 2022. Therefore, Morgan Stanleysuggests that investors looking to add value stocks to their portfolios should not do so at the expense of growth stocks, which still offer potential in areas like consumer discretionary and technology. Investors might also want to consider reducing their exposure to defensive sectors such as consumer staples, healthcare, and utilities. While these sectors were favored during the bear market in 2022, they did not perform as well when the stock market rebounded in 2023 and may continue to underperform in 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nAccording to Matt Orton, chief market strategist at Raymond James Investment Management, investors should overlook concerns regarding elevated valuations and instead concentrate on growth in what he described as a \"stockpicker's market.\" He pointed out that a significant portion of the recent market surge has been driven by the \"Magnificent 7\" mega-cap tech stocks, but they are now exhibiting varying performance trends. While there has been extensive discussion about the lofty valuations of US stocks, Orton argued that making historical comparisons may not be applicable. This is because today's market makeup is distinct, with growth stocks anticipated to achieve higher-than-average earnings growth rates, often due to their involvement in rapidly advancing sectors like technology and AI, or because they offer distinctive products or services that confer a competitive advantage, such as healthcare firms with highly sought-after weight loss medications. Matt Orton commented:\n\n\u201cI fully think that the market could push 20, 21 times, and that\u2019s a perfectly fair multiple for us to pay. It\u2019s all about earnings growth and it\u2019s all about leaning into where those fundamentals are, and trying to avoid the parts of the market where you don\u2019t have a positive inflection in earnings. And if you do that, no matter what the valuation is, you can grow into it, and I think that\u2019s the main message for investors, is \u2018find growth.\u2019\u201d\n\nSome of the best growth stocks to buy include Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), Broadcom Inc.

Both stocks suffered sharp declines in 2022, each losing more than 50% of their market capitalizations. In 2022, we purchased Netflix and added to our position in Meta on weakness as both stocks were selling significantly below our estimates of fair value. Meta\u2019s challenges were more self-inflicted as a ramp-up in spending caused free cash flow to plummet. We saw Netflix\u2019s slowing subscriber growth as a normal feature of a maturing streaming market.\n\nWith regard to Meta, the company\u2019s \u201cyear of efficiency,\u201d as 2023 was declared by Mark Zuckerberg, involved a recalibration of its spending plans to focus on profitability. While the stock also benefited from enthusiasm around artificial intelligence, the re-rating in the price multiple seems entirely rational as shares were selling for less than 10X next year\u2019s estimated earnings at its 2022 lows for a business that still had strong growth drivers, consistent free cash flow generation and a large net cash position. While Meta is included in the Magnificent Seven mega-cap stocks, Meta is trading much cheaper (~25X P/E) than all the others aside from Alphabet (~24X P/E), which is the one other of the Magnificent Seven stocks we hold. While Meta\u2019s stock is no longer extremely cheap, we feel it is still reasonably priced for a good business with attractive growth prospects. We did trim our positions in Meta and Netflix to put capital to work in names having greater discounts.\u201d\n\n8.

In 2023, operating profit margins expanded by approximately 225 basis points (bps), excluding one-time severance and real estate charges, as the Cloud segment reached breakeven profitability.

Currently, there are two phase three assets, Orforglipron, an oral GLP-1 and retatrutide, a triple incretin agonist, which have the potential to expand upon the potential success of Mounjaro. We believe that Mounjaro has the potential to commercialize beyond type 2 diabetes and obesity, potentially in the areas mentioned above of heart disease, sleep apnea, fatty liver disease and chronic kidney disease.
