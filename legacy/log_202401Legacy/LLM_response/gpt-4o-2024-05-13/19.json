Companies had to rethink their plans and prioritize financial resilience over mere growth. Despite two years of interest rate increases causing some disruptions, the global economy has stayed strong regardless of persistent inflation. Developed economies in the West might see ongoing lower inflation as they move from a slow start to an economic recovery later in the year. Even though interest rates rose quickly in 2022 and 2023, many developed countries continued to grow, showing signs of strain only recently. For 2024, Invescopredicts a slight global economic slowdown, especially during the first half of the year. The United States has been resilient compared to the slowing growth in the eurozone and the UK. However, Invesco expects this slowdown to be short-lived as monetary policy adjusts to falling inflation. The firm believes that major central banks in developed countries have likely finished hiking interest rates and will start cutting them as growth slows and inflation calms down. This should help the economy recover towards normal growth in the second half of 2024 as people's wages rise due to lower inflation.\n\nDuring economic downturns, value stocks, which are generally cheaper than growth stocks, often suffer significant declines due to investor concerns. However, they tend to perform well as the economy begins to recover. Interestingly, the rebound of value stocks following the COVID-19 pandemic was not as strong as expected. This could be because investors in 2023 anticipated a recession that did not occur. Additionally, the anticipated fiscal spending in 2024 from government acts like the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, CHIPS Act, and Inflation Reduction Act could boost sectors like finance and industrials. On the other hand, the recovery in 2023 also revived growth stocks following the downturn in 2022. Therefore, Morgan Stanleysuggests that investors looking to add value stocks to their portfolios should not do so at the expense of growth stocks, which still offer potential in areas like consumer discretionary and technology. Investors might also want to consider reducing their exposure to defensive sectors such as consumer staples, healthcare, and utilities. While these sectors were favored during the bear market in 2022, they did not perform as well when the stock market rebounded in 2023 and may continue to underperform in 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nAccording to Matt Orton, chief market strategist at Raymond James Investment Management, investors should overlook concerns regarding elevated valuations and instead concentrate on growth in what he described as a \"stockpicker's market.\" He pointed out that a significant portion of the recent market surge has been driven by the \"Magnificent 7\" mega-cap tech stocks, but they are now exhibiting varying performance trends. While there has been extensive discussion about the lofty valuations of US stocks, Orton argued that making historical comparisons may not be applicable. This is because today's market makeup is distinct, with growth stocks anticipated to achieve higher-than-average earnings growth rates, often due to their involvement in rapidly advancing sectors like technology and AI, or because they offer distinctive products or services that confer a competitive advantage, such as healthcare firms with highly sought-after weight loss medications. Matt Orton commented:\n\n\u201cI fully think that the market could push 20, 21 times, and that\u2019s a perfectly fair multiple for us to pay. It\u2019s all about earnings growth and it\u2019s all about leaning into where those fundamentals are, and trying to avoid the parts of the market where you don\u2019t have a positive inflection in earnings. And if you do that, no matter what the valuation is, you can grow into it, and I think that\u2019s the main message for investors, is \u2018find growth.\u2019\u201d\n\nSome of the best growth stocks to buy include Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), Broadcom Inc.

(NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nIn September 2023, Huawei Technologies introduced its Mate 60 Pro smartphone.

(NASDAQ:META)\u2014both categorized in the communication services sector\u2014rounded out our top five contributors in Q4 as well as for 2023. Both stocks suffered sharp declines in 2022, each losing more than 50% of their market capitalizations. In 2022, we purchased Netflix and added to our position in Meta on weakness as both stocks were selling significantly below our estimates of fair value. Meta\u2019s challenges were more self-inflicted as a ramp-up in spending caused free cash flow to plummet. We saw Netflix\u2019s slowing subscriber growth as a normal feature of a maturing streaming market.\n\nWith regard to Meta, the company\u2019s \u201cyear of efficiency,\u201d as 2023 was declared by Mark Zuckerberg, involved a recalibration of its spending plans to focus on profitability. While the stock also benefited from enthusiasm around artificial intelligence, the re-rating in the price multiple seems entirely rational as shares were selling for less than 10X next year\u2019s estimated earnings at its 2022 lows for a business that still had strong growth drivers, consistent free cash flow generation and a large net cash position. While Meta is included in the Magnificent Seven mega-cap stocks, Meta is trading much cheaper (~25X P/E) than all the others aside from Alphabet (~24X P/E), which is the one other of the Magnificent Seven stocks we hold. While Meta\u2019s stock is no longer extremely cheap, we feel it is still reasonably priced for a good business with attractive growth prospects. We did trim our positions in Meta and Netflix to put capital to work in names having greater discounts.\u201d\n\n8.

(NASDAQ:GOOG) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cIn early 2023, we initiated an investment in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), the parent company of Google, at a highly attractive valuation during a period when apprehension about the company\u2019s competitive positioning in AI overshadowed the high-quality nature of its business and strong growth prospects.\n\nSince we initiated our position, the company has delivered impressive operating results. With two of the highest ROI and most resilient ad formats in Search and YouTube, Google occupies a dominant position in the secularly fast-growing digital advertising market. As the digital advertising market recovered over the course of the year, revenue growth in Google\u2019s advertising business accelerated from 3% in Q1 2023 to 10% in Q4 2023. Moreover, the company realized significant progress on its substantial margin expansion opportunity and maintained a robust capital return program. In 2023, operating profit margins expanded by approximately 225 basis points (bps), excluding one-time severance and real estate charges, as the Cloud segment reached breakeven profitability. We expect continued cost control, automation efficiencies, and operating leverage in under-earning segments (Cloud & YouTube) to sustain margin expansion as Google invests behind AI initiatives.\n\nThe company is using its ample free cash flow to repurchase approximately 4% of its outstanding shares on an annual basis\u2026\u201d (Click here to read the full text)\n\n7.

The company operates in a single business segment, Human pharmaceutical products.\n\nEli Lilly has a deep pipeline in treatment areas focused on metabolic disorders, oncology, immunology and central nervous system disorders. Currently, there are two phase three assets, Orforglipron, an oral GLP-1 and retatrutide, a triple incretin agonist, which have the potential to expand upon the potential success of Mounjaro. We believe that Mounjaro has the potential to commercialize beyond type 2 diabetes and obesity, potentially in the areas mentioned above of heart disease, sleep apnea, fatty liver disease and chronic kidney disease. We believe the premium valuation is supported by this outsized growth profile.\u201d\n\n6.
